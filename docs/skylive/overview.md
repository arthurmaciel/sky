**Server-driven UI with the TEA architecture** (`init` / `update` / `view` / `subscriptions`). Sky.Live lets you build interactive web apps where all state, logic, and rendering live on the server. The browser runs no client-side framework — just minimal JavaScript for DOM patching and SSE reconnection.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Live as Live
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)


type Msg
    = Increment
    | Decrement


type alias Model =
    { count : Int }


init : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init _ =
    ( { count = 0 }, Cmd.none )


update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none )

        Decrement ->
            ( { model | count = model.count - 1 }, Cmd.none )


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
        , span [] [ text (String.fromInt model.count) ]
        , button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
        ]


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions _ =
    Sub.none


main =
    Live.app
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes =
            [ Live.route "/" HomePage
            ]
        , notFound = HomePage
        }
```

## How it works

1. **Initial page load:** Server renders `view model` as complete HTML. The browser receives a full static page, not a JS bundle.
2. **Event subscription:** Browser opens a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream to receive updates.
3. **User interaction:** Click / input / submit triggers a minimal fetch to `/_sky/event` with a message payload.
4. **Server update:** `update msg model` runs on the server. The result is `(newModel, cmd)`.
5. **Diff:** Server diffs `view oldModel` against `view newModel` producing a VNode patch.
6. **Patch:** Patch is sent over SSE. Client-side Sky.js applies it to the DOM (< 2 KB gzipped).
7. **Command dispatch:** If `cmd` included `Cmd.perform task msgWrapper`, the task runs in a goroutine and its result is dispatched as a new `Msg` through the same loop.

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the detailed flow and session management.

## Advantages vs traditional SPAs

- **No client-side state.** No Redux, no React hooks, no "where does this state live" debate.
- **No JSON API layer.** You write Sky types once, not duplicated client + server contracts.
- **No bundler.** No Vite, no webpack, no npm audit alerts.
- **No fetch boilerplate.** Events are just messages.
- **Single binary deploy.** `sky build` produces one executable.

## When not to use Sky.Live

- **Offline-first apps.** Sky.Live requires a live server connection.
- **Heavy client-side computation.** The server is authoritative for all state; round-trips add latency for purely-local work (canvas animation, drag interactions).
- **Public-facing static content.** A plain `Sky.Http.Server` serving pre-rendered HTML is lighter if no interactivity is needed.

## Patterns

- Auth-gated pages: check `session` in `update` or in the route handler.
- Async work: `Cmd.perform (Http.get url) GotResponse` dispatches a task, the result comes back as `GotResponse (Result Error Response)`.
- Scheduled updates: `Sub.interval 1000 Tick` emits `Tick` every second.
- Multi-page: `routes` maps URL paths to route messages; `update` responds to navigation.

See [`examples/09-live-counter`](../../examples/09-live-counter/), [`examples/12-skyvote`](../../examples/12-skyvote/), [`examples/16-skychess`](../../examples/16-skychess/) for worked examples.

## Session stores

Sky.Live supports multiple backends for session state:

| Store | Configured via | Use case |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `memory` | default | Single-instance dev / testing |
| `sqlite` | `[live] store = "sqlite", storePath = "./data.db"` | Single-instance prod |
| `redis` | `[live] store = "redis", storePath = "redis://..."` | Multi-instance deployments |
| `postgres` | `[live] store = "postgres", storePath = "postgres://..."` | Shared SQL backend |
| `firestore` | `[live] store = "firestore"` | Serverless GCP |

Configure in `sky.toml`:

```toml
[live]
port = 8000
store = "sqlite"
storePath = "./data.db"
ttl = 1800
```

## Connection status banner

Sky.Live's runtime injects a bottom-pinned banner the user's `view` doesn't have to manage. Three states:

| State | Trigger | Default chrome |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `connected` | normal operation | `display:none` |
| `reconnecting` | SSE drops, POST `/_sky/event` fails, or proxy wedge detected | amber `Reconnecting…` (after 500 ms grace) |
| `offline` | `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` consecutive retry failures | red `Connection lost — refresh to retry` |

After reaching `offline` the runtime keeps retrying SSE in the background at the max delay so a healed network recovers without a forced refresh. POST failures during the outage land in a FIFO queue (capped at `SKY_LIVE_QUEUE_MAX`) and replay automatically on reconnect.

### Reverse-proxy wedge protection

Some edges (Cloudflare without the right page rule, fly.io, custom Nginx) can rewrite an upstream 502 into a 200 OK with a non-SSE body, leaving `EventSource` to fire `open` and silently never deliver a frame. The user-visible symptom was the page pinned at `Reconnecting…` even after the server itself had recovered. The runtime defends against this on three layers:

1. **Server-side hygiene.** Every `/_sky/sse` response sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, sends a 2 KB padding line so proxy buffers flush, then immediately sends `event: hello\ndata: {"v":1,"sid":...}\n\n`. A heartbeat fires every 15 s. Every `/_sky/event` POST response carries `X-Sky-Live: 1`.
2. **Client SSE.** `connected` only flips on the `hello` event, never on raw `EventSource.open`. A 5 s watchdog tears down + reopens the stream if no hello arrives within `SKY_LIVE_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` (8 s default) or no heartbeat within `SKY_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` (35 s default ≈ 2× heartbeat).
3. **Client POST.** A 200 OK without `X-Sky-Live: 1` is treated as a wedged proxy response — never applied as a patch, always rerouted through the retry path.

### Localising the banner

Override the banner strings via the `status` field on `Live.app`. No type signature change is needed — `Live.app`'s record is open via the kernel's `appExt` extension.

```elm
main =
    Live.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view, subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ Live.route "/" HomePage ], notFound = HomePage
        , status =
            { reconnecting = "Reconnexion…"
            , offline = "Connexion perdue — actualisez la page"
            }
        }
```

Either field is optional — partial overrides fall back to the English defaults. Strings are JSON-encoded into the JS template (newlines, quotes, non-ASCII, emoji round-trip safely) and rendered via DOM `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so user-supplied content can't break out of the banner context.

## Input preservation across re-renders

Sky.Live's input-authority protocol (full spec: `input-authority-protocol.md`) keeps the user's typing safe from server-driven re-renders. Three failure modes that previously slipped through the contract have been closed:

1. **Empty patches stay on the JSON ack path.** When the server-side diff aligns away every patch (the model advanced but the client already has the typed value — the steady-state outcome of typing in a controlled field), the response is an empty JSON envelope with seq + ackInputs metadata, never a full HTML body. Before this fix, empty patches triggered the HTML fallback, which `innerHTML`-replaced the entire `sky-root` and recreated every input — blanking uncontrolled fields like password.

2. **Full-body swaps preserve every uncontrolled input.** When a full HTML replacement is genuinely needed (legitimately structural diff, navigation, first interaction), the runtime now walks every `<input>` / `<textarea>` / `<select>` in the live container and splices any whose server-rendered placeholder is uncontrolled (no `value` / `checked` / `selected` attr) across the swap. The previously-special focused-input preservation is unified into the same loop. Result: an unfocused password field survives across SSE-pushed full-body re-renders. Controlled fields still let the server win — the existing authority discipline is preserved.

3. **Open `<select>` defence.** Native dropdowns close on any DOM mutation in their subtree or in an ancestor that re-mounts them. While `document.activeElement` is a `<select>`, both the per-element patch handler (`__skyApplyPatches`) and the SSE patch handler (full-body) skip patches that touch the SELECT or any element that contains it (or is contained by it). The next user interaction (option click, blur) triggers reconciliation. Active user paths (sky-nav clicks, popstate, POST text fallback) are deliberately NOT defended — dropping them would freeze navigation. Trade-off: while a dropdown stays open, scheduled re-renders accumulate "pending" state on the server until the user blurs the SELECT.

These rules play together. **For password / secret fields specifically**: don't round-trip the value through `Model`. The form-submit pattern — `onSubmit DoSignIn` with a typed-record `args : LoginForm` — is canonical. The server never sees the secret in `Model` (so it never enters the session store) AND, with the preservation rules above, never accidentally blanks it on a server-driven re-render.

### Env-var namespace prefix

Sky.Live reads its config from env vars under the `SKY_` prefix by default — `SKY_LIVE_PORT`, `SKY_LIVE_STORE`, `SKY_LIVE_TTL`, etc. Two Sky binaries running on the same host share that namespace, which is fine for most setups but causes collision when each binary needs a different port/store/TTL.

Switch the binary's namespace via `sky.toml`:

```toml
[env]
prefix = "FENCE"
```

The runtime then reads `FENCE_LIVE_PORT`, `FENCE_LIVE_STORE`, `FENCE_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, etc. The `.env` file and shell env you supply use the prefixed names too. The prefix is trimmed of any trailing `_` so `prefix = "FENCE"` and `prefix = "FENCE_"` are equivalent.

What's affected:
- All Sky-internal namespaces: `LIVE_*`, `AUTH_*`, `LOG_*`, `DB_*`, `ENV`, `STATIC_DIR`.
- The corresponding sky.toml-derived defaults (`SetSkyDefault` calls in the generated `init()`).

What's NOT affected:
- User-supplied env-var names passed to `System.getenv` / `System.getenvOr` etc. — those read raw.
- Standard non-Sky fallbacks: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `PORT` (consulted by Sky.Live's session-store config when the prefixed override is unset).
- The compile-time-only `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET` knob, read by the Haskell compiler itself.

Backwards-compatible: omit `[env] prefix` and behaviour matches every prior Sky version exactly.
