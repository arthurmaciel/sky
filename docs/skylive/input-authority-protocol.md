Design spec for the reliability layer that guarantees **no keystroke is ever lost**, regardless of latency, race conditions, dropped requests, out-of-order responses, page navigation, or server restarts. Supersedes the purely-positional morph algorithm documented in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

Status: **partially implemented (in progress).** Recent commits on `main` have landed `__skyMorph` retirement (atomic innerHTML + focus snapshot/restore), DOM-node preservation through innerHTML swap, dirty-input scoping to typable form fields only, and dispatch-error narrowing. The full sky-id grammar / monotonic seq protocol below is still partially open work — check `git log -- runtime-go/rt/live.go` for current status.

## Motivation

The current runtime has three structural weaknesses:

1. **Positional sky-ids collide across pages.** `assignSkyIDs` in `live.go:836` emits `r.0.1.2` — purely the walk index. Two pages that share an outer wrapper (`<div class="container">`) but diverge internally end up with matching ids at structurally different elements. The diff at `diffNodes` in `live.go:911` recurses into them, tries to patch, and emits wrong HTML.

2. **No patch preservation for focused inputs on the JSON path.** `__skyApplyPatches` in `live.go:2160` does `el.innerHTML = p.html` blindly. If the server sends an innerHTML patch at any ancestor of a focused input, the input is wiped mid-keystroke. Only the `__skyMorph` path (used for full-HTML responses, not the common event path) has any focus protection, and it only covers same-tag matches.

3. **No ordering or replay protection.** Two fetches in flight can return in reversed order; the client applies both in arrival order. The older response clobbers the newer.

Under mild load on a downstream app, this produces visible input duplication on page navigation and occasional keystroke loss. Under adversarial conditions (slow 3G, tab-switching while typing, concurrent submits) it becomes unusable.

The fix is a coordinated protocol change: **stable structural identities, monotonic sequence numbers, and client-side authority for dirty DOM state.**

## Guarantees

The protocol guarantees, for any Sky.Live app recompiled against the new runtime:

- **G1: Keystroke preservation.** A character typed into an input element will not be lost to any combination of server latency, dropped patches, out-of-order responses, or patch applications — up to the point where the user blurs the input, submits, or navigates.
- **G2: Navigation durability.** Pending debounced input values are flushed to the server before any navigation Msg is dispatched.
- **G3: Monotonic consistency.** Patches are applied in sequence order. Stale patches are silently dropped.
- **G4: Collision-free identity.** No two VNodes in a single render tree share a sky-id. Structurally-different subtrees across renders never collide.
- **G5: Zero app-side changes.** Existing Sky and Sky.Live apps gain all of G1–G4 automatically after rebuild. No new syntax, no required attributes.

Explicitly **not** guaranteed (out of scope for v1):
- Offline buffering (if network is down for minutes, the loader surfaces the error).
- Multi-tab conflict resolution (last writer wins, per current session-mutex behaviour).
- Server-restart resync (next event returns 404; client must reload).

## Wire format

### Sky-id grammar

```
sky-id    = "r"                                        -- root
          | parent-id "." index "#" tag [ ":" key ]

parent-id = sky-id
index     = 1*DIGIT
tag       = 1*ALPHA                                    -- lowercase HTML tag
key       = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" )            -- disambiguator
```

**Key priority** (first match wins):
1. Explicit `Html.keyed "k" node` wrapper → `k`.
2. `name` attribute on `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `form`, `button`, `fieldset` → the attribute value.
3. No key.

Examples:

| VNode | sky-id |
|---|---|
| root `<div id="sky-root">` | `r` |
| first child `<div>` (CSS stylesheet) | `r.0#div` |
| `<header>` at index 1 | `r.1#header` |
| Email input inside a form | `r.2#main.0#form.3#input:email` |
| Keyed list item | `r.4#ul.0#li:todo-42` |

**Properties:**
- Unique within a single render (structural walk produces unique paths).
- Stable across renders when the element is structurally the same (same walk path, same tag, same key).
- Automatically differentiates across renders when structure diverges (different tag → different id).

### Request: `POST /_sky/event`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "3f2a8b...",
  "seq": 42,
  "msg": "UpdateEmail",
  "args": ["alice@example.com"],
  "handlerId": "r.2#main.0#form.3#input:email.input",
  "inputState": {
    "r.2#main.0#form.3#input:email": {
      "value": "alice@example.com",
      "seq": 42
    },
    "r.2#main.0#form.5#input:password": {
      "value": "hunter2",
      "seq": 40
    }
  }
}
```

New fields:
- **`seq`** (int64, monotonic per session, client-owned): every `POST /_sky/event` increments it. Starts at 1 on first event.
- **`inputState`** (object, optional): snapshot of every input the client considers "dirty". The key is the input's sky-id. Each entry records the *current* DOM value and the seq when the user last typed it. Server uses this to reconcile its idea of the model with reality.

Backward compat: old clients omit `seq` and `inputState`. Server treats missing `seq` as `0` (oldest), missing `inputState` as empty.

### Response: event reply

When the server has usable patches to send back as JSON:

```json
{
  "seq": 42,
  "ackInputs": {
    "r.2#main.0#form.3#input:email": 42,
    "r.2#main.0#form.5#input:password": 40
  },
  "patches": [
    {"id": "r.2#main.0#form.3#input:email", "attrs": {"value": "alice@example.com"}},
    {"id": "r.1#header.0#span:greeting", "text": "Hi, Alice"}
  ]
}
```

New fields:
- **`seq`** (int64): a **single session-wide monotonic** stamp — not an echo of `req.seq`. The server bumps `sess.outSeq` whenever it produces an outgoing frame (event reply OR SSE patch). This makes cross-channel ordering well-defined: a later frame always has a higher seq than every earlier frame, regardless of channel. Client tracks one `__skyLastAppliedSeq` and drops anything `≤` it.
- **`ackInputs`** (object, optional): per input sky-id, the largest `inputState[id].seq` the server has processed. Client uses this to retire "dirty" flags once the server has caught up.
- **`respondingTo`** (int64, optional): the `req.seq` this reply is answering. Informational only; the authoritative ordering signal is `seq`. Omitted on SSE frames (nothing to respond to).

When the server needs to send a full HTML body (first interaction, or patches all target root):

- `Content-Type: text/html`
- `X-Sky-Seq: 99` header (single session-wide seq, same counter as JSON path)
- `X-Sky-Ack-Inputs: {"r.2#...": 42, ...}` header (JSON-encoded compact form)

### Batched events: `POST /_sky/event` with `batch` field

Used by `__skyFlushAllPendingSync` on tab unload (via `navigator.sendBeacon`). Same endpoint as single events — no second route:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "3f2a8b...",
  "batch": [
    {"seq": 42, "msg": "UpdateEmail", "args": ["a@b.com"], "handlerId": "..."},
    {"seq": 43, "msg": "UpdatePhone", "args": ["+44..."],  "handlerId": "..."}
  ]
}
```

Server processes batch entries sequentially under `sess.mu`, dispatching each Msg as if it arrived on its own. Response body is ignored by `sendBeacon`, but the server still stamps out frames (via SSE) so other clients / tabs observe the state changes. When `batch` is set, top-level `msg`/`args`/`handlerId`/`seq` are ignored.

### SSE frames: `GET /_sky/subscribe`

```
event: patch
data: {"seq": 99, "ackInputs": {}, "patches": [...]}
```

Same shape as the JSON event reply. SSE frames and event replies share the **single session-wide `sess.outSeq` counter** — every mutation of session state produces the next seq, regardless of what triggered it. The server already has a single linearisation point (`sess.mu`), so there's one true ordering; exposing it as one counter lets the client resolve cross-channel races correctly. A Cmd goroutine that completes during an in-flight event reply will have its SSE frame stamped *after* the reply if the reply's dispatch ran first, or *before* if the goroutine's dispatch ran first — and the client applies in that exact order.

## Client state

```js
// Top-level session state.
var __skyClientSeq = 0;             // monotonic; client-owned, tagged on every outgoing event
var __skyLastAppliedSeq = 0;        // monotonic; server-owned, drop any frame with seq ≤ this
var __skyInputs = {};               // per sky-id → InputEntry
```

Two counters, different directions: `__skyClientSeq` is what the client stamps on outgoing events (so the server can match an inputState snapshot to its producing event). `__skyLastAppliedSeq` tracks the server's session-wide `outSeq` — a single counter covering both event replies and SSE frames, because the server has a single mutation order.

```ts
interface InputEntry {
  liveValue: string;       // most recent DOM value the user typed
  lastSentSeq: number;     // seq when this value was bundled into inputState
  lastAckedSeq: number;    // largest seq the server has acked for this id
  pendingDebounceId: number | null;  // window.setTimeout handle
  pendingSend: {msgName: string; args: any[]; hid: string} | null;
}
```

### State transitions (per input `I`)

| Event | Update |
|---|---|
| `input` fires on `I` | `I.liveValue := el.value` |
| Debounce schedules a send | `I.pendingSend := {...}`, `I.pendingDebounceId := setTimeout(…)` |
| `__skySend` flushes `I` | `I.lastSentSeq := ++__skySeq`, include `I` in `req.inputState`, clear pending |
| Response arrives with `ackInputs[I.id] = N` | `I.lastAckedSeq := max(I.lastAckedSeq, N)` |
| Patch arrives with `attrs.value` on `I` | See "Authority rule" below |
| `I` becomes unmounted (not in new DOM) | `delete __skyInputs[I.id]` |

### Authority rule (client-side patch filter)

When `__skyApplyPatches` processes a patch `p` targeting an element that is an input/textarea/select with `attrs.value`, `attrs.checked`, or `attrs.selected`:

```
entry = __skyInputs[p.id]
el    = querySelector([sky-id=p.id])

if entry exists AND (el is focused OR entry.pendingDebounceId != null):
    DROP the value/checked/selected keys from p.attrs
    // apply the rest of the patch (class, style, aria-*, etc.)

else if entry exists AND p.attrs.value == entry.liveValue:
    DROP (server is echoing our own value — no-op)

else if response.seq <= entry.lastAckedSeq:
    DROP the whole patch (stale)

else:
    APPLY
    entry.liveValue = p.attrs.value   // realign
```

The same filter runs for innerHTML patches targeting ancestors of a focused/dirty input: **an innerHTML patch that would wipe a dirty input is rewritten to a scoped patch that preserves the input's subtree.** Implementation: before applying `innerHTML`, scan the new HTML for sky-ids, diff against existing dirty inputs, and if a dirty input is inside the target, fall back to per-element patching for that subtree (morph-style).

This preserves G1 even when the server sends a "wipe your whole form and rebuild" patch.

## Server state

```go
type liveSession struct {
    // ... existing fields ...

    // Single monotonic counter for every outgoing frame (event reply OR
    // SSE patch). Bumped under sess.mu, so reflects the session's actual
    // linearisation order. Client uses this as the authoritative sequence.
    outSeq int64

    // Per-input-id → largest client seq the server has observed.
    // Used to populate ackInputs on every response. Evicted when the
    // corresponding input is no longer in the rendered tree.
    inputSeqs map[string]int64
}
```

**Why one counter not two:** every state mutation (dispatching a user event, completing a Cmd goroutine, applying a subscription tick) passes through `dispatch()` which holds `sess.mu`. There's exactly one true order. A single counter surfaces that order to the client; two counters would let the client accidentally reorder unrelated mutations that the server had already serialised.

### Server-side input reconciliation — fused into diff

Rather than pre-walk `prev` to rewrite values (O(n) extra pass, requires an index to be efficient at scale), the client's `inputState` is passed **directly into `diffNodes`** as a lookup table. The diff already walks the tree — we just consult the lookup at input nodes:

```go
func diffNodes(old, new_ *VNode, clientState map[string]string, out *[]Patch) {
    // ... existing tag/kind check, attr diff ...

    // When diffing an input-tag value/checked/selected attr, treat the
    // client-reported value as the effective old value. This prevents the
    // diff from emitting a patch that reverts the user's in-progress typing.
    if isInputTag(new_.Tag) {
        if cv, ok := clientState[old.SkyID]; ok {
            if new_.Attrs["value"] == cv {
                delete(attrChanges, "value")  // server matches DOM — no patch
            }
            // else: server genuinely wants to overwrite (form reset, etc.)
            //       emit the patch; Step 3 client filter decides whether to apply
        }
    }

    // ... recurse into children with same clientState ...
}
```

On every `POST /_sky/event`:

```
1. Read req.seq, req.inputState.
2. For each (id, {value, seq}) in req.inputState:
     if sess.inputSeqs[id] < seq:
         sess.inputSeqs[id] = seq
3. Build clientState map[sky-id]string from req.inputState.
4. Dispatch Msg as usual.
5. Call diffNodes(prev, new_, clientState, &patches).
6. Reply with {seq: ++sess.outSeq, respondingTo: req.seq,
               ackInputs: subsetOfInputSeqsInPrevTree, patches}.
```

**Why fused, not pre-pass:** the diff already walks both trees. Adding a pre-pass walks the tree twice for no benefit. Adding an index on `prev` means maintaining invalidation on every mutation — another rule to get wrong. The fused approach costs O(hash-lookup) per input node, zero extra allocations, and no state to invalidate.

**What "client authority" means on the server:** the diff is a hint, not a veto. If `update` decides `model.email = "Bob"` (form reset, admin edit, whatever), `new_.Attrs["value"]` becomes `"Bob"`, which doesn't match the client's reported value, so the diff emits `value="Bob"`. The Step 3 client filter then decides — if the user is *currently* typing into that field, the filter drops the `value` attr and the user keeps typing; otherwise the patch applies. Server model stays authoritative; client input stays unclobbered. Both invariants hold simultaneously.

## Invariants enforced

| Invariant | Mechanism | Location |
|---|---|---|
| I1 — Client authority | Patch filter drops `value`/`checked`/`selected` when input is focused/dirty | `__skyApplyPatches`, `__skyMorph` |
| I2 — Monotonic application | `response.seq ≤ lastApplied` → drop | `__skyApplyPatches`, SSE handler |
| I3 — Navigation flush | Intercept `<a>` click inside sky-root → flush debounces synchronously → send nav Msg | `__skyBindEvents`, `beforeunload` |
| I4 — Identity collision-free | Structural sky-ids with tag+key | `assignSkyIDs` in `live.go` |
| I5 — Server diff uses real DOM | `alignPrevTreeValue` merges `req.inputState` into `prev` before diffing | `/_sky/event` handler |

## Failure-mode matrix

| Scenario | Before | After | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Type fast, server responds slow with old `value` | Input reverts to old value mid-type | Patch dropped; user's value kept | I1 + I5 |
| Two sends in flight, responses arrive reversed | Older response clobbers newer | Older patch dropped via seq check | I2 |
| Click `<a>` while typing | Final keystrokes lost | Debounce flushed before nav leaves | I3 |
| Navigate to page with same outer wrapper | Inputs duplicate / wrong attrs | Different sky-ids; clean replace | I4 |
| SSE delivers duplicate frame | Frame applied twice | Second frame dropped via seq | I2 |
| Form reset via `update` sets model.email = "" | Works today, still works after | `value=""` patch applied; empty input takes effect | (no regression) |
| User types, tab-switches, comes back | Works if debounce already flushed via blur | Same: `focusout` handler flushes | I3 (existing) |
| Server sends innerHTML at parent of focused input | Input wiped, value lost | Scoped morph preserves dirty input subtree | I1 |
| Slow-3G + rapid typing | Characters skip or double | Smooth; buffered locally, flushed in seq order | I1 + I2 |

## Implementation plan

Ordered; each step is independently landable and reviewable.

### Step 1 — Structural sky-ids (Fix B)

**File:** `runtime-go/rt/live.go`

Replace `assignSkyIDs` (line 836) with:

```go
func assignSkyIDs(n *VNode, path string) {
    if n.Kind != "element" {
        return
    }
    seg := path
    if path == "r" {
        n.SkyID = "r"
    } else {
        n.SkyID = path
    }
    for i := range n.Children {
        child := &n.Children[i]
        childSeg := seg + "." + itoa(i) + "#" + child.Tag
        if k := skyIDKey(child); k != "" {
            childSeg += ":" + k
        }
        assignSkyIDs(child, childSeg)
    }
}

func skyIDKey(n *VNode) string {
    if k, ok := n.Attrs["sky-key"]; ok && k != "" {
        return sanitiseKey(k)
    }
    switch n.Tag {
    case "input", "textarea", "select", "form", "button", "fieldset":
        if k, ok := n.Attrs["name"]; ok && k != "" {
            return sanitiseKey(k)
        }
    }
    return ""
}

func sanitiseKey(s string) string {
    // Replace anything that's not [A-Za-z0-9_-] with _.
    // Prevents sky-id parse ambiguity and HTML injection.
    var b strings.Builder
    for _, r := range s {
        switch {
        case r >= 'a' && r <= 'z', r >= 'A' && r <= 'Z', r >= '0' && r <= '9', r == '-', r == '_':
            b.WriteRune(r)
        default:
            b.WriteByte('_')
        }
    }
    return b.String()
}
```

**Also:** `Html.keyed` helper added to `sky-stdlib/Sky/Html.sky` (opt-in; sets `sky-key` attribute, consumed by `skyIDKey` above):

```elm
keyed : String -> VNode -> VNode
keyed k node = Html.attr "sky-key" k node
```

**Verification:** `scripts/example-sweep.sh` must pass. Every example renders; HTML diff against main shows only sky-id format changes (longer ids, no layout change).

### Step 2 — Wire format bump

**Files:** `runtime-go/rt/live.go` (Go), embedded JS at line 2030+.

Add `seq`, `inputState`, `ackInputs` fields to request/response structs. Populate but don't yet enforce — behaviour identical to today. This is the "stub" step that makes the protocol upgradable.

Go struct additions:
```go
type eventRequest struct {
    SessionID  string                    `json:"sessionId"`
    Seq        int64                     `json:"seq,omitempty"`
    Msg        string                    `json:"msg"`
    Args       []any                     `json:"args,omitempty"`
    HandlerID  string                    `json:"handlerId,omitempty"`
    InputState map[string]inputStateEntry `json:"inputState,omitempty"`
}
type inputStateEntry struct {
    Value string `json:"value"`
    Seq   int64  `json:"seq"`
}
type eventResponse struct {
    Seq        int64            `json:"seq,omitempty"`
    AckInputs  map[string]int64 `json:"ackInputs,omitempty"`
    Patches    []Patch          `json:"patches"`
}
```

Client JS:
- On `__skySend`: bump `__skySeq`, include it in body.
- On response: capture `resp.seq` into `__skyLastAppliedEventSeq` (not enforced yet).
- On `input` event: capture `el.value` into `__skyInputs[sky-id].liveValue` (not yet used in filters).

### Step 3 — I1 client authority

**Files:** embedded JS at line 2030+ in `live.go`.

Wire the patch filter. `__skyApplyPatches` consults `__skyInputs` for every patch targeting an input/textarea/select:

```js
function __skyApplyPatches(resp) {
  var patches = resp.patches || [];
  // Ingest ackInputs first so the filter can see the latest acks.
  if (resp.ackInputs) {
    var ids = Object.keys(resp.ackInputs);
    for (var k = 0; k < ids.length; k++) {
      var e = __skyInputs[ids[k]];
      if (e) e.lastAckedSeq = Math.max(e.lastAckedSeq, resp.ackInputs[ids[k]]);
    }
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < patches.length; i++) {
    var p = patches[i];
    var el = document.querySelector('[sky-id="' + p.id.replace(/"/g, '\\"') + '"]');
    if (!el) continue;
    __skyFilterPatch(p, el);    // mutates p in place per authority rule
    __skyApplyOne(p, el);
  }
  __skyBindEvents(document);
}
```

`__skyFilterPatch` implements the authority rule from the client state section. `__skyApplyOne` holds the existing `innerHTML` / `textContent` / attr application logic.

For innerHTML patches that contain dirty inputs: parse the new HTML with a DOMParser, check whether any dirty input id is present, and if so, convert the innerHTML patch into a morph (walk new vs. old, skip dirty inputs, apply rest).

### Step 4 — I2 stale drop

**File:** same JS block.

Activate the seq check:

```js
function __skyApplyPatches(resp) {
  if (resp.seq !== undefined && resp.seq <= __skyLastAppliedEventSeq) {
    return;  // stale — a newer response already landed
  }
  __skyLastAppliedEventSeq = Math.max(__skyLastAppliedEventSeq, resp.seq || 0);
  // ... rest as in Step 3
}
```

SSE handler uses `__skyLastAppliedSubSeq` (separate counter) for subscription frames.

### Step 5 — I3 flush on unmount

**File:** same JS block.

Intercept `<a href>` clicks inside sky-root:

```js
document.addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  var a = ev.target.closest && ev.target.closest('a[href]');
  if (!a) return;
  if (!document.getElementById('sky-root').contains(a)) return;
  // External links: let the browser handle, but flush first.
  if (/^https?:/.test(a.href) && a.host !== location.host) {
    __skyFlushAllPending();
    return;
  }
  // Internal nav: let Sky.Live's client-side router handle it, but flush first.
  __skyFlushAllPending();
  // Don't preventDefault — the existing router takes over.
}, true);

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function() {
  __skyFlushAllPendingSync();  // uses navigator.sendBeacon
});

function __skyFlushAllPending() {
  var ids = Object.keys(__skyInputs);
  for (var i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
    var e = __skyInputs[ids[i]];
    if (e.pendingDebounceId !== null) {
      clearTimeout(e.pendingDebounceId);
      e.pendingDebounceId = null;
      if (e.pendingSend) {
        __skySend(e.pendingSend.msgName, e.pendingSend.args, e.pendingSend.hid,
                  {noLoader: true});
        e.pendingSend = null;
      }
    }
  }
}

function __skyFlushAllPendingSync() {
  var ids = Object.keys(__skyInputs);
  var batch = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
    var e = __skyInputs[ids[i]];
    if (e.pendingSend) batch.push(e.pendingSend);
  }
  if (batch.length === 0) return;
  navigator.sendBeacon('/_sky/event-batch', JSON.stringify({
    sessionId: __skySid, batch: batch
  }));
}
```

`/_sky/event-batch` is a new server endpoint that processes a batch of events in order before the tab closes. Best-effort — browsers guarantee `sendBeacon` delivery but not ordering across multiple beacons; a single batched beacon is reliable.

### Step 6 — Adversarial test matrix

**Go tests landed alongside Steps 1–5** (exhaustive per-step coverage
was written as each step landed rather than deferred to a single
catch-up step):

Step 1 — `runtime-go/rt/live_skyid_test.go`:
- `TestSkyIDCollisionFree` — the signIn/signUp repro.
- `TestSkyIDStableAcrossRenders` — identical trees → identical ids.
- `TestSkyIDNameBasedKey` — inputs with `name` keep identity across reorder.
- `TestSkyIDExplicitKey` — `sky-key` attr wins over name.
- `TestSkyIDKeySanitisation` — hostile keys can't escape grammar.
- `TestSkyIDTextChildrenDontGetIDs` — positional index preserved.

Step 2 — `runtime-go/rt/live_protocol_test.go`:
- `TestOutSeqMonotonic` — nextOutSeq strictly increments.
- `TestIngestInputStateKeepsMaxSeq` — per-id monotone seq.
- `TestAckInputsEvictsUnmounted` — removes ids not in prevTree.
- `TestEncodeSSEFrameShape` — valid JSON envelope.
- `TestWriteEventJSONEnvelope` / `...NoPatchesEmitsEmptyArray` — envelope shape.
- `TestWriteEventHTMLSetsProtocolHeaders` / `...OmitsEmptyAck` — header shape.
- `TestHandleEventRoundTripsSeq` — full handler round-trip.
- `TestHandleEventBatch` — sendBeacon batch path → 204.

Step 3 — `runtime-go/rt/live_authority_test.go`:
- `TestDiffAlignsToClientValue` — server matches client → no patch.
- `TestDiffOverridesClientWhenServerDisagrees` — patch still emitted on genuine override.
- `TestDiffLegacyCallerNilClientState` — legacy behaviour preserved.
- `TestDiffNonInputTagIgnoresClientState` — only form fields aligned.
- `TestDiffAuthorityAttrsChecked` — `checked` attr alignment works.

Step 6 — `runtime-go/rt/live_adversarial_test.go`:
- `TestConcurrentEventsSerialise` — 20 concurrent POSTs → 20 distinct seqs.
- `TestSeqCountsCoverEveryOutgoingFrame` — SSE frame + event reply interleave on one counter.
- `TestDiffAlignsInsideNestedForm` — deep-tree alignment.
- `TestLegacyFieldsPreserved` — pre-upgrade clients keep working.

**Browser tests deferred to a follow-up branch** — adding Playwright
(or `chromedp`) to this repo is a non-trivial tooling commitment and
keeps this PR focused on the runtime contract. The JS logic (patch
filter, stale-drop, beacon flush) is small and mechanically derived
from the Go-side invariants that *are* tested; Step 7 validates
end-to-end against a real downstream app for the regression the
protocol was designed to fix.

Manual smoke checklist (for the follow-up automation):

1. Type "hello" with 500ms server latency — all 5 characters appear.
2. Type + click `<a href>` mid-keystroke — server logs show final value.
3. Type on page A, navigate to page B — no orphan value, no state bleed.
4. Fire two submits in rapid succession — server serializes, client shows consistent final state.
5. SSE send duplicate frame — DOM not double-mutated.
6. innerHTML patch at `<form>` while `<input>` focused — input survives with user's value.
7. Kill server mid-fetch — client retries, no silent data loss.
8. Throttle to slow-3G, type continuously — no character loss.

### Step 7 — Verify on a downstream app

Rebuild a downstream app's compiler binary (`cabal install` in sky repo), rebuild the downstream app (`sky build src/Main.sky`). Manual check:

- signIn → signUp transition: no duplicated inputs.
- Type email, navigate away, come back: server remembers last typed value (via `inputState` flush).
- Open two tabs, edit session from both: one wins per session mutex (existing behaviour, documented).

## Backward compatibility

- **Runtime bump:** all Sky.Live apps must recompile to get the new runtime. No opt-out flag; the runtime is embedded via Template Haskell and shipped with the compiler binary.
- **Wire format:** additive. New fields are optional; omitting them produces the pre-upgrade behaviour.
- **Sky-id format:** changes visible in DOM (`sky-id="r.0#div.1#form..."` instead of `sky-id="r.0.1..."`). Tests that assert on sky-id strings must update. Dev tools scripts that query by `[sky-id^="r."]` continue to work.
- **No CLAUDE.md changes needed.** The public API (`Live.app`, `Html.*`, `Server.*`) is unchanged. `Html.keyed` is a new opt-in helper, documented but not required.

## Open questions — resolved

1. **Batch endpoint:** single endpoint. `POST /_sky/event` accepts an optional `batch` field; when present, top-level `msg`/`args`/`handlerId`/`seq` are ignored. One route, one mental model.

2. **Single session-wide seq counter.** The server's `sess.mu` is the single linearisation point for all mutations; exposing it as one monotonic counter lets the client resolve cross-channel races correctly. Two counters would leak implementation detail (separate request/subscription tracking) and make cross-channel ordering ambiguous. Client tracks one `__skyLastAppliedSeq`.

3. **Fused client-value alignment.** `clientState map[string]string` parameter passed to `diffNodes`. No pre-pass, no index to maintain, no invalidation rule. Consulted O(1) per input node during the walk the diff already performs.

4. **No patch reordering.** Current DFS emission order is correct. Ancestor `innerHTML` patches are self-healing — they carry the full rendered subtree, so clobbered descendant patches don't corrupt DOM state (just waste client work). Step 3's filter with innerHTML-preserving-dirty-input morph handles the edge cases categorically. Emission-ordering optimisations (suppressing descendant patches when an ancestor `innerHTML` will be emitted) are a future perf tweak, not a correctness fix.

## Approval gate

This doc is the contract. Before any of Steps 1–7 lands, the following must be confirmed:

- [ ] Sky-id grammar accepted.
- [ ] Wire format (request, response, SSE, headers) accepted.
- [ ] Invariants I1–I5 cover the guarantees G1–G5.
- [ ] Failure-mode matrix is complete (flag any missing scenario).
- [ ] Implementation sequence + verification strategy accepted.

Once approved, implementation proceeds in the step order above, one commit per step. Each commit ships its own regression test. No step is marked complete until `scripts/example-sweep.sh` passes clean-slate.
