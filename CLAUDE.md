## v0.13 State (current branch)

**Branch**: `perf/v0.13`. **Last commits** (most recent first):
```
584d2e1  verifier scripts + reflect-adapter arg narrowing fix
80dcdf9  G goto-def coverage + F3 orphan FfiT pruning + Unicode-aware ident matching
316accc  regression tests — AnonLambda + AnonRecord specs
5d2d8df  E anon-record struct decls — remove sanitiseTypedDeep cover-up
041bd70  B0 prefer Sky-defined union over runtimeTypedMap any-alias
5b59e68  G LSP 100% — every USED symbol class
ecf024f  F whole-program Sky DCE — per-dep decl pruning
3757025  D-Lambda-Lowerer + D1 typed HOF return
22ee8e0  A2/A1/B1/C — pre-register + superset records + container TVars + parametric ADTs
```

### The agreed contract (FINAL — do not relax)

**All USED Sky code → fully-typed Go.** No bare `any` for used vars /
funcs / lambdas / ADTs. ONLY genuinely-generic (Go-generic `[T any]`)
OR genuinely-unused may use Go-generic or `any`. **Sky-side DCE in
the Haskell phase pre-lowering** — Stripe-SDK-scale binding pruning.
**LSP 100%** — hover + goto-definition for every used symbol class.
**No deferral** — if a doc (this file, `docs/*.md`) says "post-v1.0",
fix the doc; the contract supersedes any old "deferred" annotations.

### Cross-cutting fixes shipped in v0.13

- **UF cycle guard in HM solver** (v0.13.1 patch) — `Sky.Type.Unify.actuallyUnify`'s FlexVar↔Structure and FlexVar↔Alias merges had no occurs check. When the v0.13 dep-fixpoint round-1 solve fed a polymorphic external annotation back into a re-export module (the trigger was importing `Std.Ui.Events`, which re-exports across the mutually-recursive `Element msg` / `Attribute msg` ADTs), the merge could splice a self-referential cycle into the UF graph; downstream `Sky.Type.Solve.variableToType` then recursed forever through cyclic `App1` args, allocating 3+ GB before mem-guard / RTS killed the host. Fix lands in two layers: (1) `Unify.actuallyUnify` now calls `Occurs.occurs` on every FlexVar↔Structure / FlexVar↔Alias merge, rejecting cycle-introducing unifications cleanly; (2) `Solve.variableToType` carries a path-tracking `seen` set so any pre-existing cycle reads back as a `TVar "_cycle"` sentinel instead of looping. Symptom in user-facing reproducer (mini-notion, a Sky.Live + Std.Ui app importing `Std.Ui.Events`): pre-fix `sky build` OOMs at 7-8 GB RSS; post-fix completes in 16 MB / <1 s. The `Occurs` helper module already existed but was never called; this fix wires it into the unify path that was the missing link. Regression fence: `test/Sky/Type/UfCycleGuardSpec.hs` (compiles the minimal `Std.Ui.Events` importer under `+RTS -M256M` — pre-fix dies with "Heap exhausted", post-fix exits 0 or 1 with a real type error). Also added top-level-only filtering for the dep-fixpoint cross-module externals map (matches the entry-module path) so let-locals + lambda params from one dep don't pollute another dep's externals.
- **Unicode-aware Go ident matching** (`isGoIdentStart` / `isGoIdentChar` in `Compile.hs` using `Char.isLetter` + `Char.isAlphaNum`). Replaced 4 ASCII-only sites that would silently slice Unicode-letter identifiers. Aligns with the parser side (`Sky.Parse.Variable.isIdentChar`).
- **Reflect-adapter arg narrowing** in `runtime-go/rt/rt.go`. The `rt.Coerce[func(any) any]` adapter (`adaptFuncValue`) used by typed-codegen now narrows each arg to `skyFn.In(i)` via `narrowReflectValue` BEFORE `reflect.Call`. Fixes the runtime panic class `reflect.Call using map[string]interface{} as type map[string]string` that surfaced in 07-todo-cli when typed `formatTodo : map[string]string -> ...` was called over `[]map[string]any` DB rows.
- **TEA dispatch fast-path** (`tupleFirst` / `tupleSecond` in `runtime-go/rt/live.go`). Type-assertion fast path for `SkyTuple2` / `SkyTuple3` before falling back to reflect. ~40 % faster per dispatch (60 ns vs 100 ns measured on Apple M1). Touches every TEA backend — Sky.Live, Sky.Tui, Sky.Cli — at the hot `update`-return path. Regression fence: `runtime-go/rt/tuple_dispatch_test.go` (6 cases — fast path on SkyTuple2/3, reflect fallback on typed T2, [2]any/[]any shape coverage, defensive non-tuple fallback). The earlier "typed tuple instantiation" attempt was consciously rolled back in v0.13 because `[]rt.T2[int, int]` and `[]rt.SkyTuple2` are distinct Go nominal types — the cross-site mismatch needed coercion at every list/dict-of-tuples site. See `solvedTypeToGo`'s TTuple comment for the design rationale; the fast-path is the focused win without re-introducing the inconsistency.
- **Map→struct narrowing in `rt.Coerce[T]`** (`runtime-go/rt/rt.go`). When source is `map[string]any` (Db.query row, Firestore snapshot, JSON-decoded blob) and target is a record alias `Foo_R = struct { ... }`, Coerce builds T field-by-field using `narrowReflectValue` per field. Probes three key forms: PascalCase exact (`Foo`), lowercase-first (`foo` — Sky's `capitalise_`-emitted convention), and full lowercase (`id` — FFI all-caps acronyms + JSON / `Db.getField` output). Closes the panic class `rt.Coerce: expected Foo_R, got map[string]interface {}` for typed-record call boundaries fed by DB / Firestore. Codegen-side: `coerceArg` and `coerceToFieldType` now route record-alias fall-throughs (`isRecordAliasTy`: identifiers ending `_R`) through `rt.Coerce[T]` instead of the raw `any(e).(T)` assertion. ADT names + FFI opaque types keep the direct assertion (no map-source panic class). Regression fence: `runtime-go/rt/coerce_map_to_struct_test.go` (6 cases — happy path, PascalCase keys, partial fields, int64→int widening, nested typed-map field, no-panic guarantee).
- **`globalUnionNames` IORef** (separate from `globalCgEnv`) so `typeStrWithAliasesReg` can do empty-home cross-module union recovery without `<<loop>>` black-holing inside a `modifyIORef globalCgEnv` callback.
- **HttpResponse runtime-type mapping** in `runtimeTypedMap` (kernel `Http.get`/`post` declare empty-home `HttpResponse`).

### Verification matrix (all 26 examples)

| Category | Count | Tool | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sky.Live + Sky.Http.Server | 10 | `scripts/verify-all-web.sh` (Playwright headless Chromium) | **10/10** |
| CLI | 7 | `scripts/verify-cli.sh` (run + panic-grep) | **7/7** |
| Sky.Tui + Sky.Cli | 5 | `scripts/verify-cli.sh` (brief spawn, non-TTY exit) | **5/5** |
| Fyne GUI | 1 | `scripts/verify-cli.sh` (`skip-gui` flag — needs X11) | skip |
| Test fixtures (`simple`, `test_pkg`) | 2 | example-sweep build-only | build-only |

Full build sweep + cabal `Sky.Build.ExampleSweep`: **26/26 green**.

### Skyshop / Stripe-scale benchmark (F + F3 win)

| | Pre-v0.13 (DCE off) | Post-v0.13 |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/13-skyshop/sky-out/main.go` | 14,398 lines | **4,178 lines** (−71%) |
| Total funcs in main.go | 3,518 | **975** (−72%) |
| Std_* funcs in main.go | 379 | **169** (−55%) |
| Emitted `Stripe_*` user-code refs | (full) | **0** (all DCE-pruned) |
| `examples/13-skyshop/sky-out/rt/stripe_bindings.go` | 326,327 lines | **58,059 lines** (−82%) |
| `type FfiT_*` aliases in stripe_bindings.go | 80,847 | **29** |
| Wrapper funcs in stripe_bindings.go | 124,312 | **57** |

### Deferred to v0.13.x (post-v0.13)

- **Install-time Go binding optimization**: `sky install` currently runs `sky-ffi-inspect` and emits the FULL `.skycache/go/<pkg>_bindings.go` (Stripe: 326k lines). With Sky DCE now identifying reachable FFI sigs pre-lowering, install could emit only `.skicache/ffi/*.skyi` (HM types), deferring the Go-binding-source generation to `sky build` time, on the reachable subset. Win: Stripe install ~8min → ~10sec; disk usage 12MB → <100KB per FFI pkg. Scope: 8-10 hrs. Right architecture; deferred to its own release for risk isolation.

## Language Convention

All documentation, comments, variable names, function names, and user-facing strings **must use British English spelling** (`optimise`, `behaviour`, `colour`, `initialise`, `serialise`, `catalogue`). Exceptions: protocol identifiers (LSP `initialize`), CSS/HTML properties (`color`), Go stdlib names.

**Unicode identifiers**: Sky source supports Unicode-letter identifiers (Go's identifier spec — `letter (letter | unicode_digit)*` where `letter = unicode_letter | '_'`). Codegen-side string scanners (FFI DCE, type-string substitution, func-name extraction) MUST use the shared `isGoIdentStart` / `isGoIdentChar` helpers (`Char.isLetter` / `Char.isAlphaNum` + `'_'`) — never write a fresh ASCII-only `c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'`-style predicate. A Sky identifier containing a Unicode letter (e.g. `mésa`) emits as the same identifier in Go; an ASCII walk would silently slice the token and misclassify the surrounding code. Parser side: `Sky.Parse.Variable.isIdentChar` is already Unicode-aware.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **If it compiles, it works.** The 2026-04-15 adversarial audit
   documented 23 counterexamples across P0 (soundness floor), P1
   (security), P2 (soundness cleanup), and P3 (tooling). All 23 are
   remediated with regression tests (see `docs/AUDIT_REMEDIATION.md`).
   v0.13 closes the residual P4 items: typed codegen eliminates `any`
   from emitted Go (workstreams A-E above); `sky test` Sky-harness
   runs through the typed path. The principle now holds for every
   path exercised by `cabal test`, `scripts/example-sweep.sh`,
   `scripts/verify-all-web.sh`, `scripts/verify-cli.sh`, and
   `runtime-go/rt/*_test.go`. Defence in depth (panic recovery +
   `Err` return at Task boundaries) remains the reliability floor.
2. **Dev experience is top priority.** Clear errors, predictable behaviour, no user-written FFI.
3. **Root-cause fixes only.** Fix at the correct abstraction layer. **Never suppress type errors or warnings.** A defensive cover-up that hides a contract violation (e.g. the pre-v0.13 `sanitiseTypedDeep` rewriting `Anon_R_*` → `any`) IS a violation; remove the cover-up by fixing the underlying gap, not by widening the mask.
4. **Production-grade architecture.** Must scale to large Go packages (Stripe SDK — 76k FFI symbols). Must remain maintainable.
5. **UI/UX/DX/security/scalability are top-notch, fit-for-purpose.** Sky is the language; Std.Ui is the default UI surface (multi-backend — Sky.Live HTTP, Sky.Tui terminal, future webview/native). `Std.Auth` ships secure defaults; `Std.Db` is connection-pooled; Sky.Live's input-authority protocol preserves typed user input across re-renders. **AI-written Sky code defaults to Std.Ui + Std.Auth + Std.Db** unless the user explicitly opts out — these surfaces are reviewed for security + scalability.

## Memory Safety (Non-Negotiable)

**The mem-guard kill-switch MUST be running during any Sky compiler dev session, example build sweep, or LSP-heavy editing on macOS.** A runaway `sky build` / `sky lsp` / `cabal` / `ghc` / `haskell-language-server` process has previously pinned the entire Mac to swap and forced a hard power-off — losing unsaved work in every app, not just the offending terminal. This is a recurring risk class, not a one-off. Treat it like a missing `set -e`: the absence is the bug.

Start it once at the top of the session and leave it running:

```bash
nohup ./scripts/mem-guard.sh > /tmp/mem-guard.out 2>&1 &
disown        # so it survives if the host shell exits
tail -f /tmp/mem-guard.log    # optional, watch what it does
```

Defaults (16GB Mac):
- Per-process kill at **6 GB RSS** for `sky` / `sky-ffi-inspect` / `cabal` / `ghc` / `ghc-iserv` / `cc1` / `ld` / `haskell-language-server` / `hls-wrapper` / `gopls`.
- Per-process kill at **10 GB RSS** (panic tier) for `claude` / `node` / `ghostty` — these are the *host* of the dev session, so the threshold is higher and the system-pressure rule additionally requires the host itself to already be over 4 GB before sacrificing it.
- System-pressure floor: when free + inactive + speculative memory drops below **1.2 GB**, kill the heaviest watched process immediately. macOS swap thrashing escalates to lock-up within seconds once free memory falls past this point — the 2-second poll interval is sized to act inside that window.

Tune via env vars: `MEM_GUARD_PROC_MB`, `MEM_GUARD_PANIC_MB`, `MEM_GUARD_SYS_FLOOR_MB`, `MEM_GUARD_INTERVAL`. `MEM_GUARD_DRY=1` runs in log-only mode for verification. The script never touches kernel processes, WindowServer, launchd, or anything outside its watch list.

**Workflow rules:**
- **Before** kicking off `cabal test` or the full `for d in examples/*/; do … done` clean-slate sweep, confirm `pgrep -f mem-guard.sh` returns a PID. If it doesn't, start it first.
- **When extending the watch list** (new compiler tool, new dev binary), add the regex to both `ALWAYS_KILL_RE` / `PANIC_KILL_RE` in `scripts/mem-guard.sh` AND mention the addition here so future sessions don't accidentally shrink the safety net.
- **If the guard fires**, log the full kill line (`grep KILL /tmp/mem-guard.log`) into the related issue or commit message — repeated kills on the same binary are a real compiler/LSP bug, not just an unlucky build.
- **Never disable the guard to silence a kill.** A kill means the offending process was on a path to OOM the machine; the fix is in the compiler/LSP, not in raising the threshold past available RAM.

## Background-Task Hygiene (Non-Negotiable)

**After completing ANY long-running mission (multi-step build sweep, CI monitoring, parallel-agent run, Playwright verification, etc.), audit and clean up all background tasks before declaring the work done.** Leftover `run_in_background` zsh wait-loops (`while pgrep ...; do sleep N; done`) accumulate silently — each `Bash(run_in_background=true)` that polls leaves a dormant `/bin/zsh -c` parent + `sleep` child alive until the polled condition clears. Across a session this can balloon into hundreds of orphan processes, exhausting the user's per-uid process table (RLIMIT_NPROC). Symptoms: `fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable` in shell output, `mem-guard.sh` unable to fork its `sleep` calls (silently dies), the user's `sky` binary getting killed instantly on launch because the OS cannot allocate a new process slot for it.

This bit the user on 2026-05-11/12 (post-v0.12 verification session) — `467` total user processes, ~30+ orphan `while pgrep` zsh wait-loops, mem-guard log frozen at `fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable`.

**End-of-mission checklist (run before reporting completion to the user):**

```bash
# 1. Kill orphan polling loops spawned by run_in_background polling patterns
ps -u $USER -o pid,command | awk '/while pgrep|until ! pgrep/ && /\/bin\/zsh -c/ {print $1}' | xargs -n1 kill -9 2>/dev/null

# 2. Kill stray sleep processes (only mine; never -9 a user-launched sleep)
ps -u $USER -o pid,ppid,command | awk '$3 == "sleep" && $2 != 1 {print $1}' | xargs -n1 kill -9 2>/dev/null

# 3. Kill stragglers from this session's verification work
pkill -f "playwright" 2>/dev/null; pkill -f "chromium" 2>/dev/null
pkill -f "examples/.*/sky-out/app" 2>/dev/null   # any app server still bound to :8000

# 4. Verify mem-guard is alive (restart if dead)
pgrep -f mem-guard.sh >/dev/null || (rm -f /tmp/mem-guard.out && nohup ./scripts/mem-guard.sh > /tmp/mem-guard.out 2>&1 & disown)

# 5. Sanity-check the user's binary still launches
sky --version
```

**Workflow rules:**
- **Prefer `Monitor`** over `run_in_background` + polling whenever possible — Monitor delivers events without spawning a wait-loop subprocess. Reserve `run_in_background` for tasks that genuinely produce final output and aren't being polled.
- **Avoid `until ! pgrep ...; do sleep N; done` patterns** in foreground Bash calls. The shell-snapshot wrapper means every Bash invocation forks a fresh zsh; long polling loops here are equivalent to `run_in_background` waitloops but worse (block the agent on top of leaking the process).
- **Audit before claiming "done"** — `ps -u $USER -o pid,command | grep -c "while pgrep\|until ! pgrep"` should return ≤ 1 (your audit grep itself). If it returns 5+, kill the rest before responding to the user.
- **Watch for `Resource temporarily unavailable`** in any tool output. This is the canary — the moment it appears, abandon whatever started the loop and run the checklist above before continuing.

## v0.10.0 Stdlib Consolidation (BREAKING)

The standard library was deduplicated. Old modules with overlapping surface have been dropped or renamed. This is a one-shot migration — there are **no compat shims**, by design.

**Renamed:**
- Sky kernel `Os` → `System`. Frees the `Os` qualifier for the Go FFI `os` package (sky-log et al. need stdin / stderr / fileWriteString from Go's std library and previously hit a kernel-vs-FFI namespace collision). Migration: `Os.exit` → `System.exit`, `Os.getenv` → `System.getenv`, `Os.cwd` → `System.cwd`, `Os.args` → `System.args`. `import Sky.Core.Os as Os` → `import Sky.Core.System as System`.

**Dropped (folded into other modules):**
- `Args.*` → `System.{args, getArg}`. `Args.getArgs ()` is now `System.args ()`. `Args.getArg n` is `System.getArg n` (now returns `Task Error (Maybe String)` per Task-everywhere — see migration helper in sky-env's Main.sky).
- `Env.*` → `System.{getenv, getenvOr, getenvInt, getenvBool}`. `Env.getOrDefault key def` → `System.getenvOr key def`, `Env.getInt key` → `System.getenvInt key`, `Env.require key` → `System.getenv key` (already errors on missing). `System.setenv` / `System.unsetenv` (v0.11.5+) cover the write side without Go FFI.
- `Slog.*` → `Log.*With`. `Slog.info msg attrs` → `Log.infoWith msg attrs` (same for warn/error/debug). The plain-message `Log.info msg` form keeps working — the `With`-suffix variants take the structured `(msg, [k,v,k,v,…])` shape Slog had.
- `Sha256.*` → `Crypto.sha256`. The chain `Sha256.sum256 (String.toBytes s) |> Result.andThen Hex.encodeToString` collapses to `Crypto.sha256 s` (returns the hex digest directly).
- `Hex.*` → `Encoding.hexEncode` / `Encoding.hexDecode`.

**Shrunk:**
- `Process.*` keeps only `run` (subprocess execution). `Process.exit` / `getEnv` / `getCwd` / `loadEnv` all moved to `System.*`.

**New:**
- `System.getenvOr key default` — no-error env read with fallback. **Bare `String` return** (not `Task Error String`) — see "default-supplied helpers stay bare" rule below the Effect Boundary table. Module-top-level usage stays sync: `apiKey _ = System.getenvOr "OPENAI_KEY" ""`.
- `System.getenvInt key` / `System.getenvBool key` — typed env reads, `Task Error Int|Bool` (CAN fail on missing or unparseable, hence Task).
- `System.getArg n` — single-arg lookup as `Task Error (Maybe String)`.
- `System.loadEnv ()` — load `.env` file (was `Process.loadEnv`).
- `Log.infoWith msg attrs` / `warnWith` / `errorWith` / `debugWith` — structured-log variants with key/value list (replaces `Slog.*`).
- sky.toml `[log] format = "plain" | "json"` and `[log] level = "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error"`. Seeds `SKY_LOG_FORMAT` / `SKY_LOG_LEVEL` defaults at compile time. Env vars still override at runtime — same precedence as `[live]`.

**Compiler infrastructure:**
- Bare-name aliases for every kernel module added to `staticKernelModules`. `Log.error` resolves without `import Std.Log` because `Log` is in the kernel registry.
- Auto-force `let _ = TaskExpr` discard semantics (already in v1.0+ doctrine, formalised here): the lowerer wraps the discarded expression in `rt.AnyTaskRun` so the side effect fires.
- `main`'s body is wrapped in `rt.AnyTaskRun` too — `main = println X` actually prints under Task-everywhere (regression discovered when migrating examples).
- Canonicaliser falls back to the kernel registry for unimported qualifiers — `Crypto.sha256` works without `import Sky.Core.Crypto`. Bug fixed: previously emitted bare `Crypto_sha256(arg)` (no `rt.` prefix), failing `go build`.
- **Dep module HM errors are FATAL.** Pass-2 type errors in dep modules used to silently degrade to `any`-typed bindings, which let real type bugs (Task being case-matched as Result, `/` instead of `//`, `Bool -> Attribute` partial-applied as `Attribute`) ship and surface as runtime symptoms like `[AUTH] Admin ensured: 0x102…` (a func-pointer of an unforced thunk being string-split). Now the build aborts with `TYPE ERROR (Mod): …` and the user fixes the dep before shipping. Pass-1 errors stay tolerated because some deps need pass 2 to disambiguate via cross-module externals. Regression test: `test/Sky/Build/DepHmFatalSpec.hs`.

The migration script at `/tmp/migrate-v0.10.sh` (see git history of this commit) handles the bulk rewrites in any external repo. Manual touch-ups needed for: `case Args.getArg n of Just/Nothing` patterns (now wrap with `Task.run |> Result.withDefault Nothing`), and `Sha256.sum256 + Hex.encodeToString` chains (collapse to `Crypto.sha256`).

## Non-Regression Rules

These constraints are enforced by `sky verify`, `test/Sky/ErrorUnificationSpec.hs`, and the audit-remediation specs under `test/Sky/**`. Violating them breaks the repo:

- **No `Result String a`** in any public surface. Use `Result Error a`.
- **No `Task String a`** in any public surface. Use `Task Error a`.
- **No `Std.IoError`** — the pre-v1 error ADT was deleted.
- **No `RemoteData`** — the pre-v1 async-state type was deleted.
- **No runtime panic from well-typed Sky code.** Every known panic class has a regression test in `runtime-go/rt/*_test.go` or `test/Sky/**Spec.hs`.
- **No silent numeric coercion.** `AsInt` / `AsBool` / `AsFloat` returning zero on type mismatch is a violation of P0-2 (see `docs/AUDIT_REMEDIATION.md`). New code uses the fallible `AsIntChecked` variants; lenient display-only helpers carry the suffix `OrZero` so the intent is visible at every call site.
- **No raw `.(T)` assertions on generated any-typed thunks.** Typed codegen must route through a runtime `Coerce` helper (see P0-3). Grep gate: `sky-out/main.go` files contain no `any(body).(T)` patterns outside the `Coerce*` helpers.
- **Record field enumeration sorts by `_fieldIndex`.** Any `Map.toList fields` in codegen that feeds field order (struct decl, auto-ctor, destructure) sorts by declaration index before emission. Violating this swaps auto-ctor parameters (P0-4).
- **Secrets are typed.** `Auth.signToken` / `Auth.verifyToken` take `String`, not `any`. `fmt.Sprintf("%v", secret)` is forbidden — explicit `.(string)` assertion on a typed boundary, with minimum-length validation (P1-4).
- **`sky check` is a superset of `sky build`.** `sky check` runs the Go emitter and invokes `go build` on the output. If `sky build` would fail, `sky check` fails (P0-1). Regression test: for every fixture in `test-files/`, both commands agree on accept/reject.
- **New AST nodes must be matched explicitly in every walker.** When you add a constructor to `Src.Expr_` / `Src.Pattern_` / `Src.TypeAnnotation_` in `src/Sky/AST/Source.hs`, grep for EVERY case-on-AST in these modules and add an explicit arm:
  - `src/Sky/Canonicalise/Expression.hs`, `Pattern.hs`, `Type.hs`
  - `src/Sky/Type/Constrain/Expression.hs`, `Pattern.hs`
  - `src/Sky/Type/Exhaustiveness.hs`
  - `src/Sky/Format/Format.hs`
  - `src/Sky/Build/Compile.hs` (lowerer)
  - `src/Sky/Lsp/Server.hs` — `exprTokens`, `exprIdents`, `exprAllRefs`, `refsInExpr`, `collectSemTokens`, `collectReferences`, plus anything that walks expressions for hover / definition / rename

  **Do NOT rely on `_ -> []` catchalls** — they silently drop the new node and surface as bugs that look nothing like "missing AST case" (semanticTokens hangs, definition jump fails, rename misses references). If a walker genuinely has no token/reference to emit for the new node, write `Src.MyNode inner -> walker inner` (transparent recurse) or `Src.MyNode _ -> []` (explicit no-op) — never leave it to the catchall. Regression artefact: the `Src.Paren` node landed in 85ef8d1 but wasn't wired into `Sky/Lsp/Server.hs`'s four walkers until v0.9.2 — broke `textDocument/definition` for every identifier inside parens AND hung `handleSemanticTokens` (pattern-match exception swallowed by the outer `try` loop).

## Testing Rules

- **Every new language feature or runtime helper needs a test.** Cabal specs for compile-time behaviour; `runtime-go/rt/*_test.go` for runtime helpers; `tests/**/*Test.sky` for stdlib semantics.
- **Every bug becomes a regression test** *before* landing the fix. The failing test is the discovery artefact; without it, the class comes back. Audit items specifically require the test to fail against HEAD~1 and pass at HEAD.
- **`sky test <file>` is the user-facing runner.** See `sky-stdlib/Sky/Test.sky` for the API.
- **Runtime verification on every push.** `sky verify` builds and runs each example, catching panics and HTTP failures that `--build-only` misses.

## Tooling Rules

- **CLI commands must be correct end-to-end.** `sky build` / `sky run` / `sky check` / `sky fmt` / `sky test` all auto-regen missing FFI bindings and propagate exit codes.
- **LSP capabilities must match `docs/tooling/lsp.md`.** If you add a capability, document it. If a feature is incomplete, narrow the claim — don't lie in docs.
- **Formatter must be idempotent.** Two passes produce byte-identical output. Fixtures in `test/Sky/Format/FormatSpec.hs` guard this.

## Effect Boundary: Task-everywhere (v0.10.0+)

Single rule: **every observable side effect returns `Task Error a`.** No two-tier split, no per-function decision overhead. (Previously the v0.9.6 doctrine carved out `println` / `Slog` / `Os.getenv` / `Time.now` as "sync convenience effects" — that's gone; the lowerer's `let _ = TaskExpr` auto-force makes the Task-everywhere shape ergonomic without `do`-notation.)

| Tier | Type | Examples | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pure** | bare `a` | `String.length`, `List.map`, `Crypto.{sha256,sha512,md5,hmacSha256}`, `Encoding.{base64,url,hex}Encode`, `Time.timeString`, `System.getenvOr` (default supplied → can't fail) | Referentially transparent, deterministic. |
| **Fallible-pure** | `Result e a` / `Maybe a` | `String.toInt`, JSON decoders, `Encoding.{base64,url,hex}Decode`, `Auth.{hashPassword, verifyPassword, signToken, verifyToken}` | Pure CPU work that can fail on malformed input. Result is a value, not an effect. |
| **Effects** | `Task Error a` | `File.*`, `Http.*`, `Process.run`, `Io.*`, `Db.*`, `Auth.{register, login, setRole}`, `Crypto.{randomBytes, randomToken}`, `Time.{sleep, now, unixMillis}`, `Random.*`, `Log.{println, info, warn, error, debug, infoWith, warnWith, errorWith, debugWith}`, `System.{getenv, getenvInt, getenvBool, cwd, args, getArg, loadEnv, setenv, unsetenv}`, `Live.app` | Anything that touches the outside world (clock, env, stdout, disk, network, DB, entropy). Composes uniformly with `Task.parallel` / `Cmd.perform` / `Task.andThen`. |
| **Diverging** | polymorphic `Int -> a` | `System.exit` | Function never returns (process terminates). Polymorphic return makes it usable as the last expression in any case branch without forcing every branch to be Task-shaped. |

**Default-supplied helpers stay bare.** `System.getenvOr key def : String`, `Maybe.withDefault def m : a`, `Result.withDefault def r : a`, `Db.getFieldOr def row k : any`, `Db.get{String,Int,Bool} k row : String|Int|Bool` — none of these can fail because the default plugs the failure case at the call site. Wrapping them in `Task` / `Result` / `Maybe` would force every call into `Task.run … |> Result.withDefault def` boilerplate — the exact pattern the helper exists to avoid. Reserve the wrap for genuinely fallible operations (no default supplied, parse may reject input, I/O may error).

### Auto-force `let _ = TaskExpr`

The lowerer special-cases `let _ = X in Y` discards: when X has type `Task e a`, it emits `_ = rt.AnyTaskRun(X)` instead of bare `_ = X`. The Task thunk is forced and its Result discarded — the side effect fires, the user gets the same eager-discard ergonomics they always had:

```elm
let
    _ = println "step 1"            -- Task auto-forced; print fires
    _ = println "step 2"            -- same
    _ = Log.infoWith "saving" [...]
in
    continue
```

This is the entire reason Task-everywhere is viable in Sky despite no `do`-notation. Without auto-force, every kernel-Task call would need explicit `Task.run` wrapping at the discard site, and forgetting would silently drop the side effect.

`rt.AnyTaskRun` handles both shapes defensively: forces `func() any` thunks, passes bare values through wrapped in Ok. Auto-force at non-Task discard sites is therefore safe (negligible runtime cost: one type-assertion).

**Rule that complements auto-force:** `let _ = X in Y` is the canonical "fire-and-forget" idiom. Don't manually wrap in `Task.run` for the discard case — write `let _ = task` and let the lowerer DTRT. Use `Task.run` explicitly when you need the `Result` for further inspection.

### Top-level bindings stay explicit

The auto-force magic applies **only** to `let _ = X` discards. Top-level module bindings of `Task`-typed values still require explicit `Task.run`:

```elm
-- Module top-level
apiKey =
    System.getenv "OPENAI_KEY"
        |> Task.run
        |> Result.withDefault ""
```

This is the deliberate single-rule trade-off: one piece of compiler magic (`let _ =` auto-force) covers the pervasive debug-trace pattern; everything else is explicit Task plumbing. No surprises about whether your value is wrapped or not.

### Two-level error handling pattern

When a Task fails inside an effectful op, the canonical pattern (demonstrated in `examples/18-job-queue/src/Main.sky`'s `withErrorReporting` and `examples/07-todo-cli/src/Main.sky`'s `reportError`) is:

1. **Generate a short correlation ID** (`Crypto.randomToken 4`) — typically 4 bytes hex.
2. **Server-side: structured log** via `Log.errorWith opName [ "errId", errId, "error", Error.toString e ]` — ops can grep their logs by the ID.
3. **Client-side: user-friendly message** via `Task.fail (Error.unexpected ("Operation failed (ref " ++ errId ++ ")"))` — a user complaining "save failed ref a3f9" maps directly to the log line.

Per app shape:
- **CLI** (`07-todo-cli`): `main = Task.run (chain |> Task.onError reportError)` where `reportError` logs + prints to stderr + `System.exit 1`.
- **Sky.Http.Server** (`08-notes-app`): handlers return `Task Error Response`; `Task.onError` recovers errors to a 4xx/5xx Response with the logged errId in the body.
- **REST API**: same as Http.Server, but the recovered Response is `Server.json (errorJson errId)` instead of HTML.
- **Sky.Live** (`18-job-queue`, `12-skyvote`, `13-skyshop`, etc.): `Cmd.perform task ResultMsg` dispatches; the `ResultMsg` handler updates a `notification` / `historyError` field in Model that the `view` renders as a banner.

FFI boundary mapping: Go `(T, error)` → `Result Error T` (the FFI trust boundary is Result; user wrappers / kernel sigs lift to Task where appropriate) | Go `error` → `Result Error ()` | panics → `Err` | nil → `Maybe` / `Result`.

### Result/Task bridges

Every Go FFI call returns `Result Error T` (the synchronous trust boundary). When the surrounding pipeline is a `Task` (Sky.Http handler, Sky.Live `Cmd.perform`, `main` returning `Task`), three bridge helpers flatten what would otherwise be nested `case`-on-Result inside `Task.andThen` lambdas:

| Helper | Type | When to reach for it |
|---|---|---|
| `Task.fromResult` | `Result e a -> Task e a` | Lift a Result-returning step (FFI call, parser) into a Task pipeline |
| `Task.andThenResult` | `(a -> Result e b) -> Task e a -> Task e b` | Chain a Result-returning step after a Task |
| `Result.andThenTask` | `(a -> Task e b) -> Result e a -> Task e b` | Chain a Task-returning step after a Result |

```elm
-- Without bridges (nested case inside Task.andThen)
case Db.connect dbUrl of
    Ok db ->
        case Db.query db "SELECT ..." of
            Ok rows ->
                Http.post url (encode rows) |> Task.andThen handleResponse
            Err e -> Task.fail e
    Err e -> Task.fail e

-- With bridges (flat pipeline)
Db.connect dbUrl
    |> Task.fromResult
    |> Task.andThenResult (\db -> Db.query db "SELECT ...")
    |> Task.andThen (\rows -> Http.post url (encode rows))
    |> Task.andThen handleResponse
```

There is **no** `Result.fromTask` / `Task -> Result` bridge. `Task.run` exists in the kernel for the runtime entry boundary, but user code should keep effectful pipelines in `Task` and let the boundary (CLI `main`, `Cmd.perform`, HTTP handler return) execute it. Collapsing a Task to a Result blocks the caller and erases effect tracking from the type — usually a sign the surrounding function should return `Task` itself.

## Environment Variable Precedence

Configuration values resolve in this order (highest priority first):

1. **System environment variables** (`export PORT=8080`, Docker `ENV`, CI vars)
2. **`.env` file** in the working directory (auto-loaded at startup, never overrides existing env vars)
3. **`sky.toml`** defaults (compiled into the binary via `init()`, only set when not already present)

This follows the standard convention (godotenv, Docker): system env vars always win so production deployments can override `.env` defaults without editing files. The `.env` file is for local development convenience.

**Env-var namespacing (v0.11.5+)**: every internal runtime read uses the `SKY_` prefix by default (`SKY_LIVE_PORT`, `SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, `SKY_LOG_FORMAT`, etc.). Projects that run multiple Sky binaries on the same host can declare a custom prefix in `sky.toml` to avoid collision:

```toml
[env]
prefix = "FENCE"
```

The compiler emits `rt.SetEnvPrefix("FENCE")` at the top of the generated `init()`, and from there the runtime reads `FENCE_LIVE_PORT`, `FENCE_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, etc. The prefix is trimmed of any trailing `_` and validated non-empty (empty falls back to `SKY`). Only Sky's INTERNAL namespace is affected — user code calling `System.getenv "DATABASE_URL"` reads the raw name, and the standard fallbacks `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` / `PORT` (consulted by Sky.Live's session-store config) stay un-prefixed because they're not in Sky's namespace. Compile-time-only knobs like `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET` are read by the Haskell compiler itself, not the generated app, so they're unaffected too.

`System.setenv name value : Task Error ()` and `System.unsetenv name : Task Error ()` (also v0.11.5+) let user code mutate process env without Go FFI — useful when the value isn't known until runtime. Reach for `[env] prefix` first; `setenv` is the escape hatch for runtime-derived values.

Sky.Live env vars (sky.toml keys live under `[live]` — there is no `[live.session]` section): `SKY_LIVE_PORT` (`port`), `SKY_LIVE_TTL` (`ttl`), `SKY_LIVE_STORE` (`store` — `memory` / `sqlite` / `redis` / `postgres`), `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` (`storePath` — sqlite file or `host:port` / `redis://…` / `postgres://…` URL), `SKY_LIVE_STATIC_DIR` (`static`), `SKY_LIVE_INPUT` (`input`), `SKY_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL` (`poll_interval`), `SKY_LIVE_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (`maxBodyBytes` — cap for `/_sky/event` POST body, default `5242880` = 5 MiB; bump for `Event.onFile` / `Event.onImage` uploads larger than that). Postgres falls back to `DATABASE_URL` and Redis to `REDIS_URL` when `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` is unset (Redis defaults further to `localhost:6379`). Auth: `SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, `SKY_AUTH_COOKIE`. Connection-status banner: `SKY_LIVE_BANNER` (default `on`; `off` / `0` / `false` to disable the chrome but keep the POST retry queue active), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_BASE_MS` (default `500`), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_MS` (default `16000`), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `10`), `SKY_LIVE_QUEUE_MAX` (default `50`), `SKY_LIVE_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `8000` — how long the client waits for the server's SSE hello handshake before treating the connection as proxy-wedged and force-reopening), `SKY_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` (default `35000` — max idle time on the SSE before the client treats the stream as silently dropped; tuned for the server's 15 s heartbeat interval × 2).

**Logging (v0.10.0+)**: `SKY_LOG_FORMAT` (`plain` default | `json`) and `SKY_LOG_LEVEL` (`debug` | `info` default | `warn` | `error`) control `Log.*` output. Project-level defaults via sky.toml `[log] format = "json" / level = "info"` — same three-layer precedence (env > `.env` > `sky.toml`). Switch to JSON in production by setting `SKY_LOG_FORMAT=json` in the deployment env; no rebuild required.

**Compiler internals (v0.12+)**: HM solver budget is now THREE-MODE:

  * `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET` UNSET → **STRUCTURAL** (default).
    Cap = `max(5,000,000, constraint_count * SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET_FACTOR)`.
    Default factor is 200, so a 100-constraint module gets the floor
    while a 1M-constraint module gets 200M. Scales with input size,
    so legitimately-large generated codebases don't trip a constant
    cap, while pathological constraint expansion (which generates
    >> N×factor solver steps from N constraints) is still caught.

  * `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET=0` → **DISABLED** (escape hatch). No cap. Debug
    only — risk of unbounded heap consumption.

  * `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET=N` (N>0) → **ABSOLUTE** (legacy / regression-test
    mode). Effective cap is exactly N. Backwards compatible with the
    pre-v0.12 wall-clock-shaped budget.

`SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET_FACTOR=K` overrides the multiplier (only relevant
in STRUCTURAL mode). All env vars read by the Haskell compiler at
build time, not the generated runtime, so they don't interact with
the `[env] prefix` namespacing.

Pre-v0.12 the bound was a fixed `5,000,000` constant. Limitation #17
hardening fence in `test/Sky/Build/SolverBudgetSpec.hs` covers all
three modes.

## Project Overview

Sky is a pure functional, ML-family language compiling to Go. The compiler is written in Haskell (GHC 9.4+) and ships as a single `sky` binary. Runtime binaries are Go output — single-file, statically-linked, no external runtime needed. See `docs/compiler/journey.md` for why the compiler moved TS → Go → Sky → Haskell. (Surface syntax is Elm-compatible; several files in `src/Sky/Type/`, `src/Sky/AST/`, `src/Sky/Reporting/`, `src/Sky/Parse/Primitives.hs` are derivative works adapted from elm/compiler under BSD-3-Clause — see `NOTICE.md`.)

## Template Sync (Non-Negotiable)

When stdlib, syntax, Sky.Live APIs, or CLI commands change, **`templates/CLAUDE.md` MUST be updated**. AI assistants use this template to write Sky code in user projects.

**User-facing doc sync** — these files mirror the same surface from a user (not AI) perspective and MUST be updated in the same commit when the underlying API changes:

- **`docs/stdlib.md`** — comprehensive user-facing stdlib reference. When you add / rename / remove a function in any kernel module, update the matching table here.
- **`docs/skyauth/overview.md`** — when `Std.Auth` surface or config changes (`hashPassword`, `signToken`, `register`, `login`, `setRole`, `[auth]` keys, env vars).
- **`docs/skydb/overview.md`** — when `Std.Db` surface or config changes (`open`, `query`, `withTransaction`, CRUD helpers, `[database]` keys, env vars).
- **`docs/skylive/overview.md`** + **`docs/skylive/architecture.md`** — when Sky.Live runtime, `Live.app` shape, session-store options, or `[live]` env vars change.
- **`docs/skyui/overview.md`** — when `Std.Ui` surface or sub-modules change (`Std.Ui.{Background, Border, Font, Region, Input, Lazy, Keyed, Responsive}`), or when an idiom like the form/onSubmit pattern or file/image upload shape evolves.
- **`README.md` "What's in the box" section** — if you add a brand-new killer module (top-level `Std.Foo`), add a callout there.

The dense reference inside CLAUDE.md (this file, "Standard Library" section) and `templates/CLAUDE.md` is for AI; the `docs/*` files are for humans. Keep both in lockstep.

## Building Examples

**NEVER run `sky build` for examples from the repo root** — it overwrites the compiler binary in `sky-out/`. Always `cd` into the example directory first:
```bash
cd examples/01-hello-world && sky build src/Main.sky
```

## Git Push / Release Checklist

**These steps are non-negotiable. `--build-only` is NOT a substitute for runtime verification. Skipping step 5 has previously shipped silent runtime regressions (v0.13.0 → v0.13.2 Std.Ui event-emission bug — buttons rendered without any sky-click attrs; cabal test passed; example-sweep --build-only passed; only step 5 would have caught it).**

1. **DID YOU rebuild the compiler?** `cabal install --overwrite-policy=always --installdir=./sky-out --install-method=copy exe:sky`
2. **DID YOU smoke-test the binary?** `sky-out/sky --version` — must print version, NOT start a server.
3. **DID YOU run the cabal test suite?** `cabal test` — every spec must pass. Pending count must match prior runs.
4. **DID YOU clean-build every example?** Loop over `examples/*/`, `rm -rf sky-out .skycache .skydeps`, `sky build src/Main.sky`. All 19+ must succeed.
5. **DID YOU runtime-verify every Sky.Live / Sky.Http app?** `scripts/verify-all-web.sh` MUST exit 0. This is the only check that catches the "click is a no-op" class of regression (events stripped at render time, page still renders, Playwright clicks succeed silently). The script enforces TWO assertions per scenario:
   - **Structural**: rendered HTML containing `<button>` or `<form>` MUST contain at least one `sky-(click|input|change|submit)=` attribute. Zero means events were dropped.
   - **Round-trip**: scenarios using `expectSkyEventAfter` MUST observe a `POST /_sky/event` after a click. Zero means the wire dispatch is dead.
6. **DID YOU runtime-verify every CLI / Sky.Tui / Sky.Cli app?** `scripts/verify-cli.sh` MUST exit 0.
7. `cd examples/12-skyvote && sky check` — 0 errors.
8. **DID YOU test in a temp dir from scratch?** `sky init mytest`, `sky build && sky run`, `sky add fmt`, `sky remove fmt`, `sky upgrade`.
9. **DID YOU verify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` matches?** New verification scripts MUST be added to CI or the regression class can ship through CI green.

**If step 5 or 6 fails, fix the root cause then re-run from step 1. Do NOT tag with a known runtime failure — even one example failing is a release blocker.**

**Why we are strict here**: the typed-codegen v0.13 work introduced new type-conversion paths (`AsListT[T]`, `AsMapT[V]`, `Coerce[T]`) whose runtime behaviour depends on `T`. A subtle T=any edge case can flip an entire app's behaviour (events dropped, lists empty, dicts missing values) without affecting the type checker. The verification scripts watch the wire, not the types.

## CI/CD Rules

When pushing to `main`, cancel any in-progress **CI build** runs (not release runs) since the new commit supersedes them:
```bash
# Cancel in-progress CI runs on main before pushing
gh run list --branch main --status in_progress --workflow CI --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId' | xargs -I{} gh run cancel {} 2>/dev/null
git push origin main
```
Never cancel **release** runs (triggered by tags) — those produce binaries users download.

## Shell Commands

Always use `-f` flag with `rm` and `cp` (`rm -f`, `rm -rf`, `cp -f`).

## Build & Test

```bash
sky init [name]                   # Create new project
sky build src/Main.sky            # Compile → sky-out/app
sky run src/Main.sky              # Build and run
sky watch src/Main.sky            # Watch sources; rebuild + restart on save
sky check src/Main.sky            # Type-check only
sky fmt src/Main.sky              # Format (opinionated, Elm-compatible)
sky test tests/MyTest.sky         # Run a Sky test module (exposing `tests : List Test`)
sky add github.com/some/package   # Add dependency + generate bindings
sky remove <package>              # Remove dependency
sky install                       # Install deps + generate missing bindings
sky update                        # Update deps to latest
sky upgrade                       # Self-upgrade binary
sky upgrade-claude                # Refresh ./CLAUDE.md from this binary's embedded template
sky lsp                           # Language Server (JSON-RPC/stdio)
sky clean                         # Remove sky-out/ dist/
sky --version                     # `sky dev` on local builds; CI injects the release version
```

Local builds read the compiler version from `app/VERSION` (literal `dev`). Release CI overwrites that file with the git tag before `cabal install`. Don't bump `sky-compiler.cabal`'s `version:` field — it's pinned to `0.0.0` by design so local and CI artefacts stay distinguishable.

### `sky watch` — file-watch-driven hot rebuild + restart

```bash
sky watch                           # entry: src/Main.sky
sky watch src/Main.sky              # explicit entry
sky watch --no-run                  # rebuild only (don't spawn the binary)
sky watch --clear                   # clear screen between rebuilds
sky watch --interval=200            # poll interval ms (default 200)
sky watch --debounce=150            # debounce window after a change (default 150)
sky watch --kill-timeout=3000       # graceful SIGTERM window before SIGKILL
sky watch --watch=docs/notes.md     # add a path (file/dir, repeatable)
```

**Watched scope (strict allowlist, no .skywatchignore):** `sky.toml` at the project root + the directory containing the entry point (recursive walk, only `.sky` files) + `tests/` at the project root if it exists. Generated dirs (`sky-out/`, `.skycache/`, `.skydeps/`, `dist-newstyle/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`) are excluded from the directory walk so a build never feedback-loops. Power users add extra paths via repeated `--watch=PATH` (file = exact, directory = recursive `.sky` walk).

**Build-error policy:** on a failing rebuild the watcher prints the error and **keeps the previously-running binary alive**. The next successful build kills + respawns. A typo halfway through a save doesn't tear down the dev session — huge DX win versus `while true; sky run; done` style loops.

**Caching:** watch reuses every layer the existing build pipeline already has:
- `.skycache/source.hash` — full short-circuit when nothing changed.
- `.skycache/lowered/` — per-module lowered IR.
- `.skycache/ffi/*.skyi` — FFI bindings; **never regenerated by watch** (`sky add/install` is the explicit step). The 8-min cold Stripe SDK introspection on skyshop is one-shot per package version, not per save.
- Go's `~/Library/Caches/go-build` — Go-side compilation units; only `main.go` changes per save, all rt + FFI archives stay cached.

Typical warm-rebuild latency: 1-2 s for small apps (live-counter, todo-cli), 2-3 s for skyvote-sized projects, 10-15 s for skyshop-sized projects with extensive Stripe FFI use.

**Sky.Live + watch is near-zero-disruption** when paired with a persistent session store. The runtime's SSE handshake auto-reconnects post-restart (banner shows `Reconnecting…` for ~1 s then clears), and the input-preservation rules keep typed values across the swap. With the memory store the user re-inits to `init`'s output on every restart — `sky watch` warns about this at startup with a one-line tip pointing at sqlite/redis/postgres/firestore.

**Signals:** Ctrl-C (SIGINT) and SIGTERM both go through the same clean teardown — the watcher's UserInterrupt-async-exception handler kills the child gracefully (SIGTERM → up to `kill-timeout` ms wait → SIGKILL fallback) and exits 0 silently. Never leaves zombies.

**What watch does NOT do:**
- No automatic `sky install` — deps don't change on a code edit, and surprise `sky-ffi-inspect` runs would burn 8 min on Stripe-sized SDKs.
- No browser auto-refresh — Sky.Live's SSE handshake handles reconnection without page reload.
- No file watching outside the allowlist — `runtime-go/`, `.skydeps/`, build artefacts are ignored. Compiler-dev workflows that need rt/ watching should use `cabal install` cycles instead.

### `sky install` performance shape

The pipeline does, in order:
1. **`go get pkg1 pkg2 …`** — single batched call; module graph computed once. Warm cache near-instant.
2. **`sky-ffi-inspect`** — invokes the Go AST inspector. CPU-heavy. Multi-mode (one inspector subprocess loading N pkgs in one `packages.Load`) so Go's loader dedupes shared transitive deps across roots — a Sky.Live app pulling Stripe SDK + Firebase + Firestore + Google APIs gets each shared dep type-checked once instead of once per root.
3. **Chunked-multi parallelism** — split missing deps into K chunks, run K inspector subprocesses in parallel. K = `min(numProcessors, 4)` by default. Override via `SKY_INSTALL_PARALLEL=1..16`.
4. **`generateBindings`** (Haskell) — emits `.skycache/ffi/<slug>.{kernel.json,skyi}` + `.skycache/go/<slug>_bindings.go` per pkg. Sub-second per pkg, parallel-safe.

**Skyshop benchmark** (18 deps, warm Go module cache, M1 Mac 8-core):
- Baseline: 67.5 s wall, 136.3 s CPU.
- Optimised: 58.5 s wall, 112.5 s CPU. **13% faster, 17% less CPU.**
- The hard floor: Stripe SDK master package alone takes ~53 s to type-check inside Go's loader. Below that is Tier 2 work (usage-driven FFI generation, only emit referenced symbols).

**Inspector mode flags**: `packages.NeedName | NeedTypes | NeedDeps | NeedImports`. `NeedSyntax` and `NeedTypesInfo` were dropped (audited every helper in `tools/sky-ffi-inspect/main.go` — none reads `pkg.Syntax` or `pkg.TypesInfo`). Output is byte-identical to the previous mode set across skyshop's 18-dep set.

**Forward-compat fallback**: a stale in-tree `bin/sky-ffi-inspect` predating the multi-mode upgrade returns a single-pkg JSON object even when given multiple argv args. The Sky-side `runInspectorMulti` detects this (array decode fails + object decode succeeds) and falls back to a per-pkg loop. Keeps `sky install` correct on stale dev binaries; loses the cross-pkg dedup speedup until contributors rebuild `bin/sky-ffi-inspect`.

## Code Formatting (`sky fmt`)

Opinionated formatter, no configuration. Output is Elm-compatible (4-space indent, leading commas, "one line or each on its own line"):
- 4-space indentation (never tabs)
- No max line width — short on one line, long ones break
- "One line or each on its own line" for args, list items, record fields
- Leading commas for multi-line lists/records
- Trailing newline; two blank lines between declarations

```elm
-- Pipelines
value
    |> transform1
    |> transform2 arg1

-- Records: leading commas when multi-line
{ firstName = "Alice"
, lastName = "Smith"
}

-- Case
case msg of
    Increment ->
        count + 1
    Decrement ->
        count - 1

-- Let/in
let
    x = compute
in
    result

-- else if: flat chains
if x > 0 then
    positive
else if x < 0 then
    negative
else
    zero
```

Safety: formatter refuses to write if output loses >1/3 of code lines (prevents silent deletion from partial AST).

## Standard Library

Single canonical module per concern after the v0.10.0 consolidation. Every kernel module is reachable via its bare name (e.g. `import Log` is the same as `import Std.Log as Log`); the `Sky.Core.X` / `Std.X` long paths are kept for cross-language familiarity but you can usually drop them.

Task.parallel : List (Task err a) -> Task err (List a)  -- goroutine-backed, first error short-circuits
Task.lazy : (() -> a) -> Task err a                      -- defer computation
List.parallelMap : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b          -- pure goroutine map
```

## Go FFI / Interop Model

### Golden Rule: Users never write FFI code

Pipeline: `sky add pkg` → inspector extracts types → compiler classifies functions → generates `.skyi` + Go wrapper with panic recovery → DCE strips unused → `sky install` auto-generates missing bindings. Large packages (>50KB) use `sky-ffi-gen` for usage-driven bindings.

### Type Mapping

**Every FFI call returns `Result Error T`.** The boundary is a trust
boundary — same trust-boundary discipline as a typed FFI port. See `docs/ffi/boundary-philosophy.md`.

This applies UNIFORMLY: method calls, constructors (`newX`), field
getters, field setters, and package-level var reads all return
`Result Error T`. No exceptions — an infallible getter still needs to
survive nil receivers and concurrent data races, and we don't want
callers checking "is this the kind of FFI that can fail?". Runtime
wrappers: `SkyFfiFieldGet` / `SkyFfiFieldSet` wrap in `Ok(value)` on
success, `Err(ErrFfi _)` on nil / missing field. Generated T-variants
(`Go_Pkg_fieldT`) return `SkyResult[any, T]` so static callers and
`|> Result.andThen` chains see the same shape. Generated any-variants
(`Go_Pkg_field`) delegate to the reflect helpers.

| Go return | Sky type |
|---|---|
| `string` / `int`/`int64` / `float64` / `bool` (element types) | `String` / `Int` / `Float` / `Bool` |
| `T` (single, no error) | `Result Error T` |
| `*T` (single pointer, no error) | `Result Error T` (opaque; nil-deref → Err via recover) |
| `(T, error)` / `error` | `Result Error T` / `Result Error ()` |
| `(T, bool)` (comma-ok) | `Result Error (Maybe T)` |
| `(T, *NamedErr)` where NamedErr implements error | `Result Error T` |
| `(T, U)` (no error/bool) | `Result Error (T, U)` |
| `*sql.DB` / `[]T` / `map[string]V` | `Result Error Db` / `Result Error (List T)` / `Result Error (Dict String V)` |
| Go struct / Go interface | Opaque type (constructor + getters + setters / method bindings, all wrapped in Result) |
| void | `Result Error ()` |

Bare `*T` returns are NOT wrapped in Maybe — Go SDK builder chains
(Firestore, Stripe) rely on chaining pointer returns. Defer-recover
catches downstream nil-deref and surfaces `Err(ErrFfi(...))`.

Nil-receiver checks are added to every method/getter/setter wrapper —
calling on a nil opaque returns `Err(ErrFfi "nil receiver: T.M")` instead
of panicking.

### Opaque Struct Pattern (Builder)

Go structs are opaque — use generated constructors and pipeline setters (value first, struct second for `|>`). Every FFI call returns `Result Error T`; the example below shows the typical "stitch values out of Results then call" pattern using `Result.andThen`:

```elm
-- Constructor: newTypeName () -> Result Error TypeName
-- Getter: typeNameFieldName : TypeName -> Result Error FieldType
-- Setter: typeNameSetFieldName : FieldType -> TypeName -> Result Error TypeName

createSession : String -> Result Error CheckoutSession
createSession successUrl =
    Stripe.newCheckoutSessionParams ()
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetSuccessURL successUrl)
        |> Result.andThen Stripe.newCheckoutSession
```

Pointer fields auto-wrapped — pass plain values. For nested structs, build inner first. Boundary failure (panic, type mismatch) surfaces as `Err`; user code chains via `Result.andThen` / `withDefault` / `case`.

## Sky.Live

Server-driven UI with the TEA architecture (model / update / view / subscriptions):
```elm
main =
    Live.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view, subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ route "/" HomePage, route "/about" AboutPage ], notFound = HomePage
        }
```
HTTP-first (full HTML on load, patches on events), SSE subscriptions, session stores (memory/SQLite/Redis/PostgreSQL/Firestore), type-safe events, VNode diffing, security (cookies, rate limiting, CORS).

### Async Commands (Cmd.perform)

`update` returns `(Model, Cmd Msg)`. Use `Cmd.perform` to run long-running Tasks in background goroutines — results are dispatched back to `update` via SSE:

```elm
type Msg = FetchData | DataLoaded (Result Error String)

update msg model =
    case msg of
        FetchData ->
            ( { model | loading = True }
            , Cmd.perform (Http.get "/api/data") DataLoaded
            )
        DataLoaded result ->
            ( { model | loading = False, data = Result.withDefault "" result }
            , Cmd.none
            )
```

| Function | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Cmd.none` | `Cmd msg` | No-op (most update branches) |
| `Cmd.perform` | `Task err a -> (Result err a -> msg) -> Cmd msg` | Run task async, dispatch result as Msg |
| `Cmd.batch` | `List (Cmd msg) -> Cmd msg` | Run multiple commands concurrently |

Concurrency: commands run in goroutines with session locking (same as subscriptions). Model is read fresh from the session store on completion — safe for multi-instance deployments.

### View-event bindings: radio groups + checkboxes

Wire-level events dispatch these args (see `__skyExtractArgs`):

| Event | Element | Args sent |
|---|---|---|
| `click`, `focus`, `blur`, `mouseover`/`mouseout`, `mousedown`/`mouseup` | any | `[]` (just the Msg) |
| `input`, `change` | `<input type="checkbox">` | `[checked : Bool]` |
| `input`, `change` | `<input type="radio">` | `[checked : Bool]` (always `True` at selection — usually not what you want) |
| `input`, `change` | `<input type="number">`/`range` | `[value : Float]` |
| `input`, `change` | text inputs, `<textarea>`, `<select>` | `[value : String]` |
| `submit` | `<form>` | `[formData]` — accepts `Dict String String` OR a typed record alias (v0.9.8+) |
| `keydown`/`keyup`/`keypress` | any | `[key : String]` |

**Radio convention: use `onClick` on each label/input, not `onInput`.** A radio's `input` event fires on selection but reports `[checked=True]` (a boolean), not the chosen `value`. Binding a typed constructor like `UpdateRole : String -> Msg` to `onInput` would get a `Bool` at runtime and the dispatch drops the event with a `Msg decode error` in the log.

```elm
-- Preferred: one fully-applied Msg per radio, dispatched on click.
choiceRow =
    label [ for "role-guardian", onClick (UpdateRole "guardian") ]
        [ input [ type "radio", name "role", value "guardian", id "role-guardian" ] []
        , text "Guardian"
        ]
```

The `for`/`id` pairing lets the browser toggle the radio natively on label click; the `onClick` on the label carries the fully-applied Msg (zero wire args) so no type coercion happens server-side. Same pattern works for checkbox groups when you want per-choice Msg variants.

### Forms with passwords (and other sensitive inputs)

**Use `onSubmit` with form data, not `onInput` per keystroke.** The pattern:

```elm
type alias AuthCreds =
    { email : String, password : String }

type Msg
    = UpdateEmail String
    | DoSignIn AuthCreds

view model =
    form [ onSubmit DoSignIn ]
        [ input
            [ type "email"
            , name "email"            -- required: name is the formData key
            , value model.email       -- email is fine to round-trip via Model
            , onInput UpdateEmail
            ] []
        , input
            [ type "password"
            , name "password"
            -- no `value` attr (don't round-trip the secret through DOM)
            -- no `onInput`     (don't dispatch per keystroke)
            ] []
        , button [ type "submit" ] [ text "Sign in" ]
        ]

update msg model =
    case msg of
        UpdateEmail e ->
            ( { model | email = e }, Cmd.none )

        DoSignIn creds ->
            -- creds.email and creds.password come straight from the typed
            -- record decode at the dispatch boundary (v0.9.8+).
            ( model, Cmd.perform (signIn creds) GotAuth )
```

**Why this matters**:

1. **Password manager extensions** (1Password, Bitwarden, browser autofill) watch DOM mutations on password inputs. Every server-driven re-render with `value=…` looks like the form changed and triggers a re-prompt / re-fill cycle. Submitting only on form submit eliminates that churn — the input's DOM stays untouched between user keystrokes and submit.

2. **Secret never lives in Model.** Without an `onInput UpdateAuthPassword` Msg, there's no Model field to populate, so the password never gets serialised into the session store (Redis, Postgres, etc.). It exists only in the browser DOM until the form submits, then briefly in the `DoSignIn` Msg's record argument until `update` consumes it. Compare to per-keystroke handlers where every Sky.Live session carries a partial password through every store round-trip.

3. **Race-free submit.** Per-keystroke onInput debounces (~150 ms) can drop the last keystroke if the user hits Enter before the debounce settles — the auth attempt then sees the wrong password and the user retries blind. Form submit reads the live DOM value, so whatever is in the input at submit time is what gets sent.

The `DoSignIn AuthCreds` constructor takes a typed record — v0.9.8's typed Msg dispatch decodes the wire form data directly into `State_AuthCreds_R{Email, Password}` via `json.Unmarshal`'s case-insensitive field matching. No runtime guessing, no per-Msg decoder boilerplate. Same pattern applies to API keys, credit-card details, anything you don't want resident in the session store.

### Connection status banner (v0.9.9+, hardened against proxy wedges in v0.11.x post-release)

Sky.Live's runtime injects a bottom-pinned status banner separate from the user's `view`. Three states:

- **connected** — `display:none`, no chrome.
- **reconnecting** — amber bar `Reconnecting…`. Shown when the SSE connection drops or a POST `/_sky/event` fails (network blip, deploy in progress, transient 5xx). 500ms grace period before painting so a one-off blip doesn't flicker.
- **offline** — red bar `Connection lost — refresh to retry`. Reached after `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` failed retries (default 10, ≈ 2 min of exponential backoff). The runtime keeps trying the SSE in the background even past this point so a healed proxy is picked up automatically — no refresh needed once the network recovers.

POST failures while reconnecting land in `__skyEventQueue` (FIFO, capped at `SKY_LIVE_QUEUE_MAX`); the SSE `hello` handler drains the queue eagerly when the server comes back, so a click during the outage replays once the connection re-establishes. Server-side seq ordering tolerates the late delivery.

**What users see during a deploy / restart**: the page pauses, banner shows `Reconnecting…` for the duration of the cutover, then clears and any in-flight clicks replay. With a persistent session store (Redis / Postgres / Firestore / SQLite) the user's Model rides through unchanged. With the memory store, the cookie still resolves but the session is gone — the user re-inits to `init`'s output. **For production deployments with restart/deploy expected, use a persistent session store**.

**Reverse-proxy hardening** (v0.11.x post-release): some edges (Cloudflare, fly.io, custom Nginx configs) rewrite an upstream 502 into a 200 OK with a non-SSE / HTML body, leaving `EventSource` to fire `open` and silently never deliver a frame — the symptom was the page pinned at `Reconnecting…` even after the server itself recovered. The runtime now defends against this on three layers:

1. **Server**: every `/_sky/sse` response sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, a 2 KB padding line to defeat residual proxy buffers, an immediate `event: hello\ndata: {"v":1,"sid":...}\n\n` handshake, and a `event: heartbeat` every 15 s. Every `/_sky/event` POST response carries `X-Sky-Live: 1`.
2. **Client SSE**: `connected` only flips on the `hello` event, never on raw `EventSource.open`. A 5 s watchdog tears down + reopens the stream when no hello arrives within `SKY_LIVE_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 8000) or no heartbeat within `SKY_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` (default 35000 ≈ 2× heartbeat interval). Each forced reopen counts as a retry attempt and uses the existing exponential backoff schedule. After max attempts the banner flips to `offline` but reopens KEEP firing in the background at the max delay so a healed proxy recovers without a refresh.
3. **Client POST**: a 200 OK without `X-Sky-Live: 1` is treated as a wedged proxy response — never applied as a patch, always rerouted through the retry path. JSON responses missing the `seq` field are also rejected (some proxies emit JSON error envelopes with 200 OK). A backwards-compat shim during rolling deploys: structurally-valid JSON (with `seq`) without the marker still passes, so an old binary returning {seq, patches} alongside a marker-aware client is non-breaking.

Opt-out via `SKY_LIVE_BANNER=off` (or `0` / `false`) keeps the retry queue active but suppresses the chrome — useful when an app renders its own connection UI in the user's view. Override the styling via `#__sky-status { ... !important }` in the user's stylesheet; the runtime uses inline styles + max z-index so user CSS wins on conflict.

**Localising the banner text** (i18n): override the two user-facing strings via the `status` field on `Live.app`. No type signature change is needed — `Live.app`'s record is open via the kernel's `appExt` extension, so the field is purely additive:

```elm
main =
    Live.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view, subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ Live.route "/" HomePage ], notFound = HomePage
        , status =
            { reconnecting = "Reconnexion…"
            , offline = "Connexion perdue — actualisez la page"
            }
        }
```

Either field is optional — partial overrides fall back to the English defaults (`"Reconnecting…"` / `"Connection lost — refresh to retry"`). Strings are JSON-encoded into the JS template (so newlines, quotes, non-ASCII, emoji round-trip safely) and rendered via DOM `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so user content can't break out of the banner. Same precedence as other Sky.Live config: app-level `status` field wins; env-var defaults fall through if absent.

### Input preservation across re-renders (v0.11.x post-release hardening)

Sky.Live's input-authority protocol (full spec in `docs/skylive/input-authority-protocol.md`) protects the user's typing from being clobbered by server-driven re-renders. Three failure modes were previously left uncovered and have now been closed:

1. **Empty patches must JSON-ack, not HTML-fallback.** When alignment in `clientStateFromRequest` correctly drops every diff (the model advanced but the client already has the typed value), `dispatchRoot` used to misclassify the resulting empty patch list as "diff failed → send full HTML". The HTML fallback then went through `__skyPatch`, which `innerHTML`-replaces `sky-root` and recreates every input — blanking uncontrolled fields like password. Fix: `dispatchRoot` now sends an empty JSON envelope (with seq + ackInputs) on empty patches, parallel to the existing byte-identical-render branch. The client's `__skyApplyPatches([])` is a no-op so the DOM stays untouched. Regression test: `runtime-go/rt/live_input_preservation_test.go` `TestEmptyAlignedDiffStaysJson`.

2. **Full-body swap preserves every uncontrolled input, not just the focused one.** `__skyReplaceHTMLPreservingFocus` only spliced `document.activeElement` across the swap; every other input got recreated by the innerHTML assignment. A user who tabbed away from a password field after typing into it would see the field blanked on the next full-body re-render. Fix: the helper now walks every `INPUT` / `TEXTAREA` / `SELECT` in the live container, locates each in the new tree (sky-id preferred; tag+name fallback only when unambiguous), and splices any that the server rendered as **uncontrolled** (no `value` / `checked` / `selected` attr; for `<textarea>` no children content; for `<select>` no `option[selected]`). Controlled fields with a server-supplied value still let the server win — the existing authority discipline is preserved. The previously-special focused-input path is unified into the same loop (focus is always preserved regardless of controlled-ness). Regression test: `TestLiveJS_PreserveAllUncontrolledInputs`.

3. **Open `<select>` defence.** Native dropdowns close on any DOM mutation in their subtree OR an ancestor that re-mounts them — even a no-op `setAttribute`. A scheduled re-render (Tick subscription, Cmd.perform completion) firing while the user has a dropdown open used to collapse it mid-pick. There's no JS API to detect "dropdown open"; the runtime now uses `document.activeElement === SELECT` as a conservative proxy. `__skyApplyPatches` skips any patch where the target element is the focused select, contains it (ancestor that would re-mount), or is contained by it (descendant option). The SSE patch handler skips full-body re-renders for the same reason. Active user paths (sky-nav clicks, popstate, POST text fallback) are deliberately NOT defended — dropping them would freeze navigation. Trade-off: while the dropdown stays open, Tick subscriptions accumulate "pending" state on the server; the next user interaction (option click, blur) triggers a fresh response and reconciliation. Regression test: `TestLiveJS_OpenSelectDefence`.

### Dispatch error handling

`dispatch()` is wrapped in `defer/recover`. Two classes are handled cleanly:

1. **Msg decode errors** — client's wire args don't fit the Msg constructor's parameter types (e.g. radio `onInput` bound to `String -> Msg`). `applyMsgArgs` detects the mismatch before `reflect.Call`, logs a targeted message (constructor name, expected type, actual arg), and drops the event. No model mutation.
2. **User-code panics** — anything inside `update`/`view`/`guard` that panics (typed-FFI boundary mismatches, nil deref in user code, etc.) is caught, stack-traced to stderr, and the event is dropped. Session state stays consistent so the next event dispatches normally.

Both paths return an empty body; the client sees an empty patch list and the DOM is unchanged. Check server logs for `[sky.live] dispatch panic recovered` or `[sky.live] Msg decode error` when debugging an event that "does nothing".

### Sky.Http.Server
```elm
main =
    Server.listen 8000
        [ Server.get "/" (\_ -> Task.succeed (Server.text "Hello!"))
        , Server.get "/api/users/:id" getUser
        , Server.post "/api/data" handlePost
        , Server.static "/assets" "./public"
        ]
```
Routes: `get/post/put/delete/any` | Groups with prefix | Cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) | Extractors: `param`, `queryParam`, `header`, `getCookie` | Responses: `text`, `json`, `html`, `withStatus`, `redirect` | Middleware: `Handler -> Handler`

## Std.Ui — typed no-CSS layout DSL

Layered above `Std.Html`; renders to inline-styled HTML on the server side and Sky.Live's wire ferries diffs to the browser. Pick `row` / `column` / `el` for layout, attach typed attributes from `Background` / `Border` / `Font` / `Region` sub-modules, never write CSS. Full user-facing reference: `docs/skyui/overview.md`. Prior-art attribution: `NOTICE.md`.

```elm
import Std.Ui as Ui
import Std.Ui exposing (Element)
import Std.Ui.Background as Background
import Std.Ui.Border as Border
import Std.Ui.Font as Font

view : Model -> any
view model =
    Ui.layout []
        (Ui.row
            [ Ui.spacing 12, Ui.padding 16
            , Background.color (Ui.rgb 255 102 0)
            , Font.color (Ui.rgb 255 255 255)
            , Border.rounded 4
            ]
            [ Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Decrement, label = Ui.text "−" }
            , Ui.el [ Font.size 24, Font.bold ] (Ui.text (String.fromInt model.count))
            , Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Increment, label = Ui.text "+" }
            ])
```

**Three idioms AI tooling MUST get right when writing Sky.Ui code:**

1. **Forms with sensitive inputs use `Ui.form` + `Ui.onSubmit DoSignIn`, NOT `onInput` per keystroke on password fields.** The wire driver decodes formData `{"username":"...","password":"..."}` into a typed `LoginForm` record via case-insensitive `json.Unmarshal`. Three wins: password manager extensions stop seeing DOM mutations on every render, the secret never enters Model so never serialises into Redis/Postgres/Firestore session stores, race-free submit reads live DOM not a debounced keystroke. The username field MAY round-trip via `value` + `onInput`; the password field MUST NOT. See `examples/19-skyforum/src/View/Login.sky` for the canonical shape.

2. **For real `<input>` elements, use `Ui.input`, NOT `Ui.el [ htmlAttribute "type" "text" ]`.** `Ui.el` builds `Node` which renders as `<div>` — browsers ignore `type=`/`value=` on non-input elements and never fire input events on a div. `Ui.input` builds `TaggedNode "input"` which the renderer routes to a real `<input>` with self-closing void emission.

3. **For Std.Ui-heavy modules (~25+ polymorphic `Element Msg` helpers + many nested calls), split the view layer across multiple modules.** A single monolithic Main.sky can blow the HM type-checker heap (CLAUDE.md Limitation #17 — "HM type-checker heap exhaustion on Std.Ui-heavy modules"). The canonical split is `State.sky` (types + pure helpers, no Std.Ui imports) / `Update.sky` / `View/Common.sky` / one View module per page / `Main.sky` dispatcher. `examples/19-skyforum`'s 8-module form delivers the full Reddit-style feature surface and type-checks in 1.11 s / 369 MB; the equivalent monolithic `test-fixtures/heap-bound-fence.sky` (kept as the regression artefact) allocates 2.6 GB/s pre-fix.

**Surface highlights** (full table in `docs/skyui/overview.md`):
- Layout: `el` / `row` / `column` / `wrappedRow` (children wrap to next line via flex-wrap) / `grid` (CSS-Grid auto-fit — set min column width via `Ui.gridColumns N` attr; right primitive for product grids / dashboards / image galleries; immune to flex-vs-image collapse) / `paragraph` / `textColumn` / `text` / `none` / `html` (escape hatch wrapping a Std.Html VNode)
- Sized elements: `link` (with `{url, label}` cfg), `image` (with `{src, description}` cfg), `button` (with `{onPress, label}` cfg), `input` (real `<input>` element), `form` (with `onSubmit msg`)
- Length: `px` / `fill` (bare) / `fillPortion Int` / `content` / `shrink` / `minimum Int Length` / `maximum Int Length` / `vh Int` (viewport height %) / `vw Int` (viewport width %)
- Padding: `padding Int` / `paddingXY x y` / `paddingEach { top, right, bottom, left }` (record-shaped, matches `Border.widthEach` + elm-ui) / `spacing Int`. **`paddingXY` is X-first, Y-second** — `paddingXY 24 16` = 24px horizontal (left/right), 16px vertical (top/bottom). Matches elm-ui and the wider XY-coord convention. BREAKING (v0.11.x post-release): the previous shape was `paddingXY vertical horizontal`; migration is to swap the two args at every call site. No compat shim — both shapes type-check identically as `Int -> Int -> Attribute msg` so a quiet runtime swap would be worse than the loud break.
- Attributes: `width` / `height` / `centerX` / `centerY` / `alignLeft` / `alignRight` / `alignTop` / `alignBottom` / `pointer` / `style` / `class` / `htmlAttribute` / `name`
- Overflow: `clip` / `clipX` / `clipY` / `scrollbars` / `scrollbarX` / `scrollbarY`
- Nearby: `above` / `below` / `onLeft` / `onRight` / `inFront` / `behind` (absolute-positioned overlays for tooltips, popovers, badges; renderer wraps parent with `position: relative`)
- Events: `onClick msg` / `onSubmit msg` / `onInput (String -> msg)` / `onChange (String -> msg)` / `onFocus msg` / `onMouseOver msg` / `onMouseOut msg` / `onKeyDown msg` / `onFile (String -> msg)` / `onImage (String -> msg)`
- File/image hints: `fileMaxSize Int` (bytes) / `fileMaxWidth Int` / `fileMaxHeight Int` (resize before upload)
- Colour: `rgb Int Int Int` / `rgba Int Int Int Float` / `white` / `black` / `transparent`
- Sub-modules:
  - `Std.Ui.Background` — `color` / `image url` / `linearGradient angle stops` / `gradient css`
  - `Std.Ui.Border` — `color` / `width` / `widthEach {top,right,bottom,left}` / `rounded` / `solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` / `shadow {offsetX,offsetY,blur,spread,color}` / `glow blur color` / `innerShadow {…}`
  - `Std.Ui.Font` — `color` / `family` / `size` / `weight` / `bold` / `semiBold` / `regular` / `light` / `extraBold` / `black` / `italic` / `underline` / `noDecoration` / `lineThrough` / `overline` / `letterSpacing em` / `wordSpacing em` / `alignLeft` / `alignRight` / `alignCenter` / `center` / `justify` / `sansSerif` / `serif` / `monospace`
  - `Std.Ui.Region` — semantic landmarks routed to real HTML tags by the renderer: `heading n` (`<h1>`..`<h6>`) / `mainContent` (`<main>`) / `navigation` (`<nav>`) / `footer` (`<footer>`) / `aside` (`<aside>`) / `label text` (`aria-label`) / `announce` (`aria-live="polite"`) / `announceUrgently` (`aria-live="assertive"`)
  - `Std.Ui.Input` — typed form controls: `button` / `text` / `multiline` / `email` / `username` / `search` / `currentPassword {show: Bool}` / `newPassword {show: Bool}` / `checkbox` / `radio {options, selected, …}` / `radioRow {…}` / `slider {min, max, step, value, …}` + `option value labelEl` (RadioOption ctor) + `labelAbove` / `labelBelow` / `labelLeft` / `labelRight` / `labelHidden` / `placeholder`
  - `Std.Ui.Lazy` — `lazy` / `lazy2` … `lazy5`. v0.12+: kernel-mapped to a runtime LRU cache (default 1024 entries; `SKY_UI_LAZY_CAP=N` to override). Cache key = function-pointer + args fingerprint. Stable subtrees (long lists, repeated render passes) hit the cache; pathological cases fall back gracefully (cache miss, no benefit).
  - `Std.Ui.Keyed` — `keyed` (emits `sky-key` for diff identity)
  - `Std.Ui.Responsive` — `classifyDevice` / `adapt {phone, tablet, desktop}`

**File / image upload pattern:**
```elm
type Msg = ... | AvatarSelected String | ...

Ui.input
    [ Ui.htmlAttribute "type" "file"
    , Ui.htmlAttribute "accept" "image/*"
    , Ui.onImage AvatarSelected           -- AvatarSelected : String -> Msg
    , Ui.fileMaxSize   2_000_000          -- 2MB browser-side cap (not security)
    , Ui.fileMaxWidth  800                -- auto-resize + JPEG @ 0.85 before upload
    , Ui.fileMaxHeight 800
    ]
```
Callback receives the data URL (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`) as a single `String`. Decode with `Std.Encoding.base64Decode` → upload via `Http.post`. Server-side, ensure `[live] maxBodyBytes` in `sky.toml` is ≥ your `fileMaxSize` (default 5 MiB).

**`Ui.none` workaround:** the canonicaliser strips the type parameter from cross-module references to `Std.Ui.none` today — use `Ui.text ""` where you'd want `Ui.none`. An empty Text node renders identically (just an empty inline span).

## Language Syntax

Sky's surface syntax is deliberately Elm-compatible — modules, `case`/`let`/`if`, record literals, ADTs, `|>` pipelines port over with mechanical edits. See `NOTICE.md` for prior-art attribution.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)
import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.Task as Task
import Std.Log exposing (println)

type Msg = Increment | Decrement

update : Msg -> Int -> Int
update msg count =
    case msg of
        Increment -> count + 1
        Decrement -> count - 1

main =
    println (String.fromInt (update Increment 0))
```

Key syntax: `|>` `<|` pipelines | `::` cons | `\x -> x + 1` lambdas | `let...in` | `case...of` with exhaustiveness | `{ record | field = value }` update | `module M exposing (..)` / `import M as Alias exposing (func)`

### Multiline Strings

Triple-quoted strings preserve newlines and indentation. Interpolation uses `{{expr}}`:

```elm
html =
    """<div class="card">
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{description}}</p>
</div>"""
```

Single braces `{` are literal — safe for JavaScript, CSS, JSON, SQL. Interpolation expressions can be identifiers, field access (`{{record.field}}`), qualified names (`{{String.fromInt n}}`), or function calls (`{{String.fromInt count}}`).

## Sky.Tui v1 (branch: `exp/tea-core`)

**Status (2026-05-09):** v1 hardened for public experimental release on `exp/tea-core`, NOT yet merged to main.

A TEA backend that renders `Std.Ui` to ANSI cells in a terminal. Same `init`/`update`/`view`/`subscriptions` shape as `Sky.Live`, no HTML, no SSE. Entry point: `Tui_app` in `runtime-go/rt/tui_ui.go` (~2400 lines).

### `Tui.app` config surface

```elm
type alias Cfg model msg =
    { init          : () -> (model, Cmd msg)
    , update        : msg -> model -> (model, Cmd msg)
    , view          : model -> Element msg
    , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg
    , onKey         : KeyEvent -> msg            -- optional; runtime hard-exits on Ctrl-C if absent
    , guard         : msg -> model -> Result Error ()  -- optional; same shape + semantics as Live.app's guard
    , canvasWidth   : Int                        -- optional; default 1280 logical px
    , canvasHeight  : Int                        -- optional; default 720
    }

type alias KeyEvent =
    { kind  : String   -- "char" | "enter" | "tab" | "space" | "backspace"
                        --   | "escape" | "up" | "down" | "left" | "right"
                        --   | "home" | "end" | "delete" | "pageup" | "pagedown"
                        --   | "ctrl" | "fn" | "paste" | "mouse" | "other"
    , value : String   -- char body, ctrl letter, fn number, paste body, etc.
    , shift : Bool     -- modifier flags (set when terminal sends CSI 1;<mod>X)
    , alt   : Bool
    , ctrl  : Bool
    }

main = Tui.app cfg |> Task.run
```

### Logical-pixel canvas

`canvasWidth × canvasHeight` defines the design surface in logical pixels. The runtime computes `pxPerCellX = canvasWidth / cols` and `pxPerCellY = canvasHeight / rows` from the live terminal size, then converts every `Ui.padding 8`, `Ui.spacing 4`, `Ui.px N` to cells via `pxToCells*`. Default 1280×720 matches a typical web canvas — Std.Ui apps written for the browser look right in the terminal without re-tuning. Override via `canvasWidth = 800` if you want denser layout.

Hard cap at 100,000 in either dimension; overshoot triggers a `tuiWarn`.

### Coverage

~95%+ of Std.Ui primitives. Unsupported attributes (gradients, fine letter-spacing, image fills) emit a deduped warning via `tuiWarn(category, detail)`; the warning summary prints on exit AFTER the terminal is restored. `SKY_TUI_QUIET=1` suppresses, `SKY_TUI_LOG=1` writes a ledger file.

**Supported:**
- Layout: row, column, wrappedRow, paragraph (word-wrap), textColumn, grid + gridColumns, el
- Text styling: bold, italic, underline, lineThrough, fg/bg colour (truecolour SGR; suppressed under `NO_COLOR`)
- Headings h1-h6 with distinct visual markers (`═ ─ ▌ ▎ ▏ ·`)
- Borders: solid, dashed, dotted with widthEach
- Inputs: text, password (masked), checkbox (☐/☑), radio (○/●), slider, multiline textarea
- Events: onClick, onInput, onFocus, onSubmit (form record-decode), mouse left-press (SGR 1006), scroll wheel (3 cells/notch). Release / drag / middle / right-click are deliberately deferred — the v0.12 surface is press + wheel; sliders take values via keyboard arrows.
- Nearby overlays: above / below / onLeft / onRight / inFront / behind
- Alignment: alignX/alignY (left/center/right, top/center/bottom)
- Padding (incl. paddingXY, paddingEach), spacing
- Focus ring with Tab + arrow-key cycling, focus indicator (`▸ ◂` for buttons, underline for links). Enter **and** Space activate the focused button (browser convention) before the keypress reaches user `onKey`.
- Resize via SIGWINCH
- **Wide chars (CJK + emoji + ZWJ family)** — proper grapheme cluster + display-width measurement via `github.com/rivo/uniseg` (MIT, see NOTICE.md)
- **Bracketed paste** — multi-line paste into a single-line input no longer fires phantom Enter; pastes capped at 1 MiB
- **Modified arrows** — Ctrl-Left/Right do word-jump in inputs; Shift/Alt/Ctrl flags pass through to user `onKey`

### Reliability + security floor

These are enforced runtime invariants — every panic / signal / malformed input path was audited before the experimental tag.

| Concern | Floor |
|---|---|
| Goroutine panic (Cmd.perform, key reader, SIGWINCH, Sub.every) | `safeGo` wrapper restores TTY before exiting |
| External SIGTERM / SIGHUP / SIGQUIT / SIGINT-from-outside | trapped → tuiTeardown → exit 128+signum |
| Panic on main goroutine | deferred tuiTeardown + DECSTR soft reset on exit |
| ANSI injection via user text | `sanitiseRune` strips control bytes (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F); all paint paths route through it |
| Wide-char column drift | `displayWidth`/`iterGraphemes` from uniseg; continuation cell marker `ch=""` keeps paintDiff in sync |
| Resource exhaustion (runaway view height) | hard cap `tuiMaxContentH = 50,000`; soft warn at 10,000 |
| `TERM=dumb` / non-TTY stdin | refused with friendly error before raw mode |
| `NO_COLOR` env | colour SGR suppressed; bold/underline/reverse retained |
| Readline corruption after exit (mosh) | DECSTR (`\x1b[!p`) + charset reset (`\x0f\x1b(B`) + scroll-region reset (`\x1b[r`) on every teardown path |

**Logical-pixel canvas:** 1280×720 by default. `pxToCellsX/Y` round positive px values smaller than half a cell UP to 1 (rather than 0) so `Ui.spacing 4` stays visible in 80-col terminals.

**Tests:** `runtime-go/rt/tui_{wrap,decode,editor,sanitize,scroll,width}_test.go` — ~90+ cases. `go test ./rt/...` passes.

**Kitchen sink:** `examples/24-tui-kitchen-sink` exercises every supported primitive. `sky run src/Main.sky` to see it. To preview the same UI as Sky.Live: `sky run src/Main.sky live` (when the unified-backend dispatch lands — task #48).

### Auth guard

`Tui.app`'s `guard` field has the same shape + semantics as `Live.app`'s — `Msg -> Model -> Result Error ()`. The runtime invokes it BEFORE every `update`. `Ok ()` allows the msg through. `Err reason` skips update and (if the user's model has `notification` / `notificationType` fields) writes the rejection reason there for the view to render.

```elm
type alias Model =
    { session       : Maybe Session
    , notification  : String        -- runtime stamps guard rejections here
    , notificationType : String     -- runtime stamps "error" alongside
    , ...
    }

guard : Msg -> Model -> Result Error ()
guard msg model =
    case msg of
        Logout       -> Ok ()                    -- always allowed
        ViewSecret   -> requireAuth model        -- gated
        _            -> Ok ()                    -- public

requireAuth : Model -> Result Error ()
requireAuth model =
    case model.session of
        Just _  -> Ok ()
        Nothing -> Err (Error.unexpected "Login required")
```

When the user's model doesn't have those fields, guard rejection silently drops the msg (RecordUpdate is a graceful no-op on missing fields). The same `guard` function works under both `Tui.app` and `Live.app` — auth logic is portable across backends.

### Sky.Cli password mode (v1.x post-release)

`Cli.readPassword : () -> Task Error String` reads one line from stdin with terminal echo disabled. Wraps `golang.org/x/term`'s `ReadPassword`. Use from a `Cmd.perform` task in auth flows — the password never echoes to screen and never lands in scrollback. Falls back to a normal line read if stdin isn't a TTY (so piped scripts still work, just without echo suppression).

```elm
type Msg = AskPassword | GotPassword (Result Error String) | ...

update msg model =
    case msg of
        AskPassword ->
            ( model
            , Cmd.perform (Cli.readPassword ()) GotPassword
            )
        GotPassword (Ok pw) ->
            -- pw is the typed password; never echoed to screen
            ...
```

**Next milestone:** Sky.Webview (after Sky.Tui v1 ships to users for feedback). Branch will likely stay open until then.

## Compiler Optimisation Strategy (keep up to date)

**This section must be kept current.** Any session changing the compiler pipeline, codegen, or build system must update it.

### Current Optimisations (implemented)

1. **Stale file cleanup** — `rm -f sky-out/sky_ffi_*.go sky-out/sky_*.go sky-out/live_init.go` at build start
2. **Empty wrapper deletion** — DCE deletes FFI wrapper files with no remaining functions
3. **Native DCE** (`bin/sky-dce`) — single-pass wrapper + main.go DCE, 27s → 1s
4. **Var declaration preservation** — DCE preserves all `var` decls (type constructors, FFI aliases)
5. **Large .skyi filtering** (`bin/skyi-filter`) — Stripe SDK: 147K→9K lines in 90ms
6. **Combined FFI imports** — deduplicate before loading (was parsing 8.4MB Stripe SDK 40+ times)
7. **FFI light path** — skip type-check + lowering for `.skyi`, generate constructors + wrapper vars only
8. **Parallel module lowering** — `List.parallelMap` with goroutines, ~300% CPU
9. **Parallel FFI loading/wrapper copying** — concurrent `skyi-filter` and file I/O
10. **String.join in hot paths** — O(n²) → O(n) in lowerer
11. **Incremental compilation** — `.skycache/lowered/` cache, skip type-check + lowering on warm builds
12. **Usage-driven FFI** (`sky-ffi-gen`) — Stripe 8896 types → only referenced symbols
13. **Runtime optimisations** — `sky_equal` type-switch, `sky_asString` via `strconv`, ASCII fast paths
14. **ADT structs** (v0.7.10+) — `SkyADT{Tag: N, SkyName: "Name", V0: val}`, integer tag matching, struct field access
15. **Type annotations** — `// sky:type funcName : Type` comments on all declarations
16. **Single-binary release** — `tools/sky-ffi-inspect/` Go source embedded via TH (`Sky.Build.EmbeddedInspector`); materialises + go-builds to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/sky/tools/sky-ffi-inspect-<hash>/` on first `sky add`. Cold-start ~4s, warm instant. Content-hash keys the cache dir so `sky upgrade` auto-invalidates. Dev workflow still picks up `bin/sky-ffi-inspect` via ancestor walk so contributors don't rebuild per branch.

### Historical Fixes (all resolved)

All issues below are FIXED — listed for context if debugging regressions:

- **Formatter** — 7 fixes for output compatibility; all 32 modules format+compile; idempotent output
- **Parser** — `(expr).field` support, `parseCaseBranches` nesting fix (`branchCol` tracking), long-line splits, `getLexemeAt1` field access
- **Lowerer** — nested case IIFEs, ADT sub-pattern matching, cons pattern `len == N`, string pattern double-quoting, local variable shadowing by `exposedStdlib` (check `paramNames` first), hardcoded `Css.` prefix vs import aliases, let-binding hoisting (3-round bootstrap)
- **Type checker** — working since v0.7.2; inner case extraction across Types/Unify/Infer/Adt modules
- **FFI** — `.skycache` path resolution, Task boundary, Go generics filtered, keyword conflicts, IIFE invocation, type alias emission, interface pointer dereference, zero-arity params, callback function types, method/constant collision, slice-of-pointer types, namespace collisions
- **Lexer** — `alias` removed from keywords (contextual only)
- **Type safety audit** — 33 gaps fixed: case fallthrough panics, FFI panic recovery, float-aware arithmetic, rune-based strings, numeric sorting, typed FFI boundaries, session ADT rebuilding, exhaustiveness checking

### Known Limitations (v0.11.0, updated for v0.13)

These are current compiler limitations users must work around. Items marked ~~strikethrough~~ + FIXED are kept for context (their entries explain the failure mode + the fix); the active list is everything not struck through.

**v0.13 closed** (do not re-document as open):

* **Limitation #1** (anonymous records in function signatures) — closed by E (anon-record struct decl emission). `synthAnonRecordName` registers shapes in `globalAnonRecords`; `generateAnonRecordDecls` emits `type Anon_R_<hash> = struct { ... }` per shape. The pre-v0.13 `sanitiseTypedDeep` `Anon_R_* → any` cover-up is removed (kept as pass-through for ABI).
* **Limitation #12** (typed codegen keeps `any` inside runtime kernels) — substantially closed by C + D + B0. Typed `*T` kernel variants emitted on reachable paths. Residual SkyCall reflect dispatch remains for non-literal HOF args (uses `narrowReflectValue` for arg-narrowing safety).
* **Limitation #18** (typed `(String -> Msg)` callback emit + lambda-lowerer for user-defined HOFs) — closed by D (D-Lambda-Lowerer in `coerceCallArgsAt`'s no-CSI fallback) + D1 (typed return in `renderHofParamTy`). `HofTypedMsgSpec` updated to assert the typed shape; `AnonLambdaSpec` covers the broader regression class.
* **Stripe-scale FFI bloat** — closed by F + F3. Whole-program DCE + orphan `type FfiT_*` alias pruning. Skyshop `stripe_bindings.go` 326k → 58k lines (−82%); 80,847 → 29 type aliases. Pre-v0.13 `dceFfiWrappers` only stripped wrapper bodies; v0.13 also strips orphan type aliases via `pruneOrphanFfiTypes` (Unicode-aware identifier scan).
* **LSP gaps** — closed by G. Every USED symbol class has hover + (where applicable) goto-def coverage. 17 cabal-fenced tests across small + huge-FFI fixtures. `Sky.Lsp.NvimDriverSpec` runs the suite headless via `nvim`.

**v0.13.x deferred** (post-v0.13, not blocking):

* **Install-time Go binding optimisation** — `sky install` still emits the full `.skycache/go/<pkg>_bindings.go`. With Sky DCE now identifying the reachable set pre-lowering, install could skip Go-source generation entirely and let `sky build` generate only the reachable subset on demand. Stripe install would drop from ~8 min to ~10 sec, disk usage from ~12 MB to <100 KB per FFI pkg. Right architecture; deferred for risk-isolation.

1. **No anonymous records in function signatures** — Record types must be defined as type aliases; inline `{ field : Type }` in annotations is not supported. Typed codegen cannot name an un-aliased record for struct emission.
2. **No higher-kinded types** — No `Functor`, `Monad`, etc. Use concrete types. (Intentional — Hindley-Milner only.)
3. **No `where` clauses** — Use `let...in` instead. (Intentional.)
4. **No custom operators** — Only built-in operators (`|>`, `<|`, `++`, `::`, etc.). (Intentional.)
5. **Negative literal arguments need parentheses** — `f -1` parses as `f - 1` (subtraction). Use `f (-1)` — matches Elm's behaviour.
6. **`Dict.toList` returns string keys** — Sky's `Dict` uses `map[string]any` internally, so `Dict.toList` returns string keys even for `Dict Int v`. Arithmetic on these keys silently produces 0. **Workaround**: iterate over known key ranges with `Dict.get` instead of using `Dict.toList`.
7. **`sky check` does not fully model Go interface satisfaction** — Opaque FFI types unify with each other (v0.7.21 fix), but the checker still cannot verify that a concrete Go type (e.g. `Label`) satisfies a named Go interface (e.g. `CanvasObject`). Calls like `Fyne.windowSetContent window label` may fail `sky check` but compile and run correctly.
8. **Zero-arg FFI functions take `()` in Sky, not bare-name** — the inspector emits a `() -> R` signature for every zero-param Go function (`emitSkyiFn` in `src/Sky/Build/FfiGen.hs:1542`), so the Sky-side call is `Uuid.newString ()` / `Stripe.newCheckoutSessionParams ()` / `FyneApp.new ()`. (Sky-side **kernel** zero-arity bindings — `Uuid.v4`, `Time.now`, etc. — are the opposite: kernel-registered as bare values, called without `()`. The distinction is FFI-vs-kernel, not zero-arg-or-not.)
9. **Let bindings with parameters after multi-line case** — A let binding like `mark j = expr` after a `case ... of` in the same let block causes the parser to misinterpret it as a new top-level declaration. **Workaround**: use lambdas (`\j -> expr`) or extract to a top-level function.
10. **Zero-arity functions reading env vars** — Zero-arity functions are memoised and their import aliases evaluate at Go init time (before `.env` is loaded). If a zero-arity function reads `Os.getenv`, the value is cached as empty. **Workaround**: add a dummy `_` parameter: `getConfig _ = Os.getenv "KEY"`.
11. **`exposing (Type(..))` doesn't expose ADT constructors for user modules** — `import MyModule exposing (MyType(..))` does not bring `MyType`'s constructors into scope for user-defined modules. The canonicaliser only resolves constructors when full dep info is available (kernel modules work). **Workaround**: use `import MyModule exposing (..)` to expose everything, or qualify constructors: `MyModule.MyConstructor`.
12. **Typed codegen keeps `any` inside runtime kernels.** The typed surface is zero-`any`, but the v1.0-era reflection dispatch lives on inside `Dict_*`, `List_map`, `Html_render`. User code never sees it; observable cost is ~5% CPU vs. a hypothetical fully-generic runtime. Scheduled for the post-v1.0 runtime port (see the Typed Codegen TODO section).
13. **Zero-arg `Css.*` constants require `()`** — `Css.zero`, `Css.auto`, `Css.none`, `Css.transparent`, `Css.inherit`, `Css.initial`, `Css.borderBox`, `Css.systemFont`, `Css.monoFont`, `Css.userSelectNone` are kernel bindings exposed as `() -> String` to sidestep zero-arity memoisation (which would interact badly with Go's `init()` ordering). Write `Css.margin (Css.zero ())` not `Css.margin Css.zero` — the latter serialises the function pointer (e.g. `0xc00001c0a0`) into the stylesheet. Sky's type checker doesn't flag the miss today because the `() -> String` surface unifies with any String slot via HM's let-polymorphism default. **Pattern**: any `Css.X` that names a CSS keyword (not a value constructor like `px`/`rem`/`hex`) takes `()`.
14. **`import X as Alias` leaks the alias into codegen for exposed record/ADT types** — `import Lib.Db as Chat` causes `Message` to be emitted as `Chat_Message_R` instead of the module-prefixed `Lib_Db_Message_R`, breaking cross-module resolution when another module imports it unaliased. **Workaround**: use `import Lib.Db exposing (Message, …)` (or qualify without alias). Aliases on modules that only expose functions (no types) are unaffected.
15. **`let` bindings don't support forward references** — Helpers inside a `let` block must be defined *before* their consumers in source order. `let writeAll db = … insertRow db ts …; insertRow db ts = …` fails `go build` with `undefined: insertRow` even though both are visible at the let-block scope. **Workaround**: reorder so dependencies come first. Surfaced when refactoring 18-job-queue/saveSnapshot's nested-andThen chain into named helpers; the lowerer emits each let binding sequentially without the let-as-mutually-recursive-rec semantics that Haskell `where` (and Sky's own top-level decls) provides. Worth a future fix — the canonicaliser already knows the full set of let names in the block.
16. **Some kernel functions still missing HM type signatures** — Status as of 2026-04-27. **Dangerous-class gap is closed** (commits `f77888c` + 2026-04-27 follow-up): the `feat/effect-boundary-audit` branch added 57/66, then 10 more (`Server.static`, `Middleware.{withCors, withLogging, withBasicAuth, withRateLimit}`, `Http.{get, post}`, `JsonDec.map4`, `JsonDecP.{custom, requiredAt}`). `System.cwd` and `System.exit` were already registered (the v0.10.0 renames of `Os.cwd` / `Process.exit`). Regression fence: `test/Sky/Build/KernelSigCoverageSpec.hs` source-greps each entry — drops trip the spec at build time. **Remaining dangerous gap closed (v0.12)**: `Ffi.{call, callPure, callTask, has, isPure}` now have HM kernel sigs. Decision on the heterogeneous-list shape: kept `List any` since Sky.Ffi is the explicit FFI escape hatch — users who reach for it accept that the args list packs values of mixed types in exchange for direct access to bindings without static sigs. Pinned by KernelSigCoverageSpec "Sky.Ffi escape-hatch (v0.12)". **Bare-type sweep landed 2026-04-27**: 46 additional sigs across `Char.*` (6 — predicates + case helpers), `Crypto.*` (5 — sha256/sha512/md5/hmacSha256/constantTimeEqual), `Path.*` (4 — base/dir/ext/isAbsolute), `Math.*` (5 — e/sin/cos/tan/log), `Time.*` (6 — format helpers + addMillis/diffMillis), `String.*` (6 — casefold/equalFold/isEmail/isUrl/trimEnd/trimStart), `Css.*` (19 — Sprintf-returning length/transform/value helpers + `()`-keyword constants per Limitation #13). All return Go primitives (`String` / `Int` / `Bool` / `Float`); the runtime functions were inspected per-entry to ensure the sig matches the actual return shape. **Deliberately NOT added** (would cause `rt.Coerce[T]` runtime panic at the boundary): `Css.*` helpers returning opaque `cssRule` / `cssProp` / `cssMediaRule` (~100 entries), `Html.*` returning `vnode` (66), `Attr.*` returning `attr` struct (49), `Event.*` returning `eventPair` (24). These need the typed-codegen runtime port (post-v1.0 — see "Typed Codegen TODO") before they can be safely sigged. **Symptom of a dangerous-class regression** (kernel sig disagreeing with runtime return shape) is a runtime panic like `rt.AsInt: expected numeric value, got rt.SkyMaybe[interface{}]` — when you see this, check `lookupKernelType` (`src/Sky/Type/Constrain/Expression.hs`) against the matching `runtime-go/rt/*.go` helper.
17. **~~HM type-checker heap exhaustion on Std.Ui-heavy modules.~~ FIXED 2026-04-27.** **Root cause turned out NOT to be a compiler-internal quadratic** — bisect showed it was a single ill-typed line in `sky-stdlib/Std/Ui/Input.sky`'s `inputBase` helper: `:: Ui.onInput (cfg.onChange cfg.text)` — passing a `Msg` (the result of applying the callback to the text) where `Ui.onInput : (String -> msg) -> Attribute msg` expects a function. Because `inputBase` was polymorphic over `msg`, HM didn't reject immediately; it tried to unify `msg = (String -> someMsg)` and propagated that constraint through every Std.Ui call site, hitting combinatorial explosion (~2.6 GB/s allocation, 4-5 GB RSS in 10s — enough to lock the Mac, which is why `scripts/mem-guard.sh` exists). The fix shipped in `dc1359b` (2026-04-26): `Ui.onInput cfg.onChange` — pass the function directly. Bisect verification: reverting only `Std.Ui.Input.sky` to its pre-`dc1359b` state reproduces the OOM exactly (783 MB allocated, 543 MB max residency at 256 MB cap); current state allocates 122 MB / 1.6 MB residency. Regression fence lives in `test/Sky/Build/HeapBoundedHmSpec.hs` — re-runs `sky check` on `examples/19-skyforum/test-fixtures/heap-bound-fence.sky` (the 689-line monolithic reproducer, kept specifically for this) under `+RTS -M256M`. **Defensive bound landed 2026-04-27** (commit follows this entry — see git log for the exact hash). The HM solver now caps total `solveHelp` invocations per `solve` call at `SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET` steps (default 5,000,000 — ~50× the largest legitimate Std.Ui-heavy module measured). When the cap is exceeded, the solver short-circuits with a clear, actionable `TYPE ERROR: constraint solver exceeded budget (N operations)` rather than letting unbounded heap consumption OOM the host. The error message points at the most likely cause (mistyped polymorphic helper) and includes the env-var override path. **Both stdlib-side and user-side pathological constraint shapes are now covered** — the HeapBoundedHmSpec catches stdlib regressions at test time; the defensive bound catches user-side patterns at compile time. SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET=0 disables the bound (escape hatch — debug only). Regression specs: `test/Sky/Build/SolverBudgetSpec.hs` (default budget passes / low budget trips with clear error / 0 disables). **Workarounds for non-skyforum code that hits a similar shape**: (a) inline event handlers at use sites instead of via typed `(String -> Msg)` helper functions, (b) prefer flat `List.map` rendering over mutually-recursive view helpers, (c) split heavy view modules per the `examples/19-skyforum` 8-module pattern. The `scripts/mem-guard.sh` rule in "Memory Safety (Non-Negotiable)" stays in force as a host-side safety net.
19. **~~TEA app-runner kernel functions lack closed-record HM signatures.~~ FIXED (commit follows in git log).** `Live.app`, `Tui.app`, `Cli.program` now have closed-record HM kernel sigs in `lookupKernelType` with row-polymorphic extension (`appExt` row variable absorbs optional / extra fields like `guard`, `onKey`, `canvasWidth`, `api`). Required fields (`init`/`update`/`view`/`subscriptions` for all three; `+ onLine` for Cli) are enforced at type-check time. Plus the record renderer in `Sky.Type.Solve` now lists actual field names + types instead of the truncated `{ ... }` placeholder, so error messages tell the user EXACTLY which field is missing or wrong-typed. The LSP's `isLikelyExternalsFalsePositive` heuristic is gone — the LSP's diagnostics now match `sky check`'s 1:1, including the issue #52 case. Regression specs: `test/Sky/Lsp/DiagnosticsSpec.hs` "Limitation #19 — Tui.app missing required field" (asserts `subscriptions` shows in the diagnostic when omitted) + "TEA with Live.app: wrong view return type surfaces a real diagnostic" (asserts `view : ... -> String` vs `... -> VNode` is rendered with field names). Original symptoms (kept for context):

    - **Missing required field passes type-check, panics at runtime.** `Live.app { init = init, update = update, view = view }` (no routes, no notFound, no subscriptions) builds fine, then crashes on first request with a useless `nil pointer` or `interface conversion` error.
    - **Wrong-shape view (partial app) passes type-check, panics at runtime.** Issue #52's case: `view : Model -> any; view model = Ui.layout [] (codeSection)` where `codeSection : Model -> Element` — the user forgot to apply `model`. Sky HM should reject (Element-msg-fn ≠ Element) but doesn't because the cfg type is open. Crashes with `interface conversion: interface {} is func(interface {}) interface {}, not rt.SkyADT` on first GET.
    - **Misnamed cfg fields silently ignored.** `view = view, sub = subscriptions` (typo) compiles; the runtime sees no Subscriptions field and does nothing.
    - **LSP can't help either.** Without an HM sig, the LSP doesn't know which fields are required, so red squiggles never appear.

    **Proper fix** is to define closed-record HM signatures for these kernel functions via `lookupKernelType` (`src/Sky/Type/Constrain/Expression.hs`):

    ```hs
    ("Live", "app") -> TLambda
        (TRecord [
          ("init",          a -> (model, Cmd msg)),
          ("update",        msg -> model -> (model, Cmd msg)),
          ("view",          model -> any),
          ("subscriptions", model -> Sub msg),
          ("routes",        List (Route page)),
          ("notFound",      page),
          ("guard",         Maybe (msg -> model -> Result Error ())),
          ("api",           Maybe (List Endpoint)),
          ...
        ])
        (Task Error ())
    ```

    Once defined, HM enforces each field's presence + shape at compile time, the LSP gets the same checks for free, and the partial-application class of bug from #52 surfaces with a real type error.

    **Workaround for now**: hand-write a wrapper in user code that takes a typed cfg record alias and forwards to the kernel:

    ```elm
    type alias TuiCfg model msg =
        { init : () -> (model, Cmd msg)
        , update : msg -> model -> (model, Cmd msg)
        , view : model -> Element msg
        , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg
        , onKey : KeyEvent -> msg
        , guard : msg -> model -> Result Error ()
        }

    runTui : TuiCfg model msg -> Task Error ()
    runTui cfg = Tui.app cfg
    ```

    The wrapper IS HM-checked (the cfg parameter has a closed record type), so calling `runTui {init=…}` without the other fields gets a real "field missing" error. The compromise is one extra level of indirection per app, but it gives users compile-time safety until the kernel-side fix lands. Issue #52 tracks the proper fix.

18. **~~Typed codegen monomorphises `(String -> msg)` callback params + empty-list-in-typed-ctor-arg.~~ FIXED 2026-04-26.** Two related bugs in one limitation, both closed by `[compile] fix Limitation #18` (commit `fa6cbf0`):
    - **Empty-list-in-typed-ctor-arg**: `Item 1 "x" []` against a `type alias Item = { ..., tags : List String }` shipped `Item(1, "x", []any{})` — `go build` rejected `[]any{} as []string`. Root cause: `collectFuncTypesWith` only registered param types for `Can.TypedDef` bindings; auto-generated record ctors are unannotated `Can.Def`s, so `_cg_funcParamTypes[Item]` was empty and `coerceArg` short-circuited. Fix: walk `Can._aliases` too and register `(qualName, fieldGoTys, qualName ++ "_R")` for each `DataRecord` alias. Empty list now coerces via `rt.AsListT[string]([]any{})` — fully typed (Go generic, no reflect). Regression test: `test/Sky/Build/RecordCtorEmptyListSpec.hs`.
    - **`(String -> Msg)` helper callback param**: a helper `textField : String -> String -> (String -> Msg) -> Element Msg` got `cb func(string) any` in its emitted Go sig (load-bearing widening — Sky lambdas always lower to `func(any) any` and Go has no function-type covariance, so the helper sig must accept the widest shape). But the call-site `textField "u" "" Msg_X` shipped the typed `Msg_X : func(string) Msg` raw — `go build` rejected. Root cause: `safeReturnTypeWith` returned bare `"any"` for `T.TLambda`, so `_cg_funcParamTypes[textField]` knew the param was "any" and `coerceArg` short-circuited. Fix: `safeReturnTypeWith` now renders `T.TLambda` as `func(X) any` (matching what `renderHofParamTy` emits at sig time) — this gives `coerceArg` the `func(` prefix it needs to route call-site args through `rt.Coerce[func(X) any]`. The reflect.MakeFunc adapter handles both Sky lambdas (`func(any) any`) and typed Msg ctors (`func(string) Msg`) uniformly. Pragmatic — not "fully typed" in the strict sense (the `any` tail return is a structural compromise) but unblocks user code today; truly fully-typed HOFs need lambda lowering to preserve types (post-v1 work in "Typed Codegen TODO"). Regression test: `test/Sky/Build/HofTypedMsgSpec.hs`. The pre-existing `CompileSpec` "Result-typed lambda params" test (line 80-97) is the regression fence — `renderHofParamTy` is unchanged so Bug #1 from sky-chat ep07 stays fixed.

### Recently Fixed (listed for regression context)

#### v0.13 (perf/v0.13 branch — typed-codegen completion — 2026-05-15)

Seven workstreams (A→G) + cross-cutting fixes. See "v0.13 State"
section at the top of this file for the full state. Commit log:

* **A2** (`22ee8e0`) — `constrainDecls` pre-registers UNANNOTATED
  `Can.Def`s via an outer CLet header so forward refs (e.g. `main`
  → a `view` declared later) bind to the real defType var, not a
  CLocal-minted fresh var. Annotated `Can.TypedDef`s left
  sequential to preserve polymorphic-per-use-site semantics —
  pre-registering with `Forall []` would collapse the same `a`
  across distinct same-module call sites. New `walkDecls` helper
  handles the per-decl scoping under the outer header. Regression:
  `test/Sky/Build/AnonLambdaSpec.hs` exercises the integration.

* **A1** (`22ee8e0`) — `lookupRecordAlias` + `matchAliasByFieldSet`
  do superset match on open records. The HM solver emits
  `T.TRecord fields (Just rowExt)` for any function accessing a
  record subset via `.field`; pre-A1 the exact-only lookup returned
  Nothing and the renderer fell back to `any`. Smallest-superset
  alias wins; tied sizes → Nothing (ambiguous → renderer falls back
  to `any`, correctness preserved).

* **B1+B0** (`22ee8e0` + `041bd70`) — Parametric ADT erased-Go-name
  in `safeReturnType` (changed `T.TType _ _ []` to `_`); Sky-defined
  union name in `_cg_unionNames` takes precedence over
  `runtimeTypedMap`'s any-aliased entry. `Attribute` (defined in
  both `Std.Ui` and `Std.Html.Attributes`) emits as
  `Std_Ui_Attribute` / `Std_Html_Attributes_Attribute` instead of
  `rt.SkyAttribute = any`. 19-skyforum: 109 refs flipped.

* **C** (`22ee8e0`) — `tvarsInEmitted` recurses into List/Dict/Set
  args + the `usedTypeParams` filter in `splitInferredSigWithReg`
  matches against PARAM strings only (Go's generic inference only
  works from input positions). Return-only TVars (e.g. `b` in
  `concatMap : (a -> List b) -> List a -> List b` when fn's return
  is blanket-`any`) collapse to `[]any` rather than emit a
  `cannot infer T2` Go-build error. Lands the right ceiling until
  D-Lambda-Lowerer makes typed-output lambdas at user-defined HOFs
  work end-to-end.

* **D + D-Lambda-Lowerer + D1** (`3757025`) — Five coordinated fixes
  closing typed lambda output at user-defined HOF call sites:
  - `coerceCallArgsAt`'s no-CSI fallback (where user-defined HOF
    calls land) now routes literal `Can.Lambda` args at func-typed
    param slots through `curryLambdaPatTyped`, matching what the
    CSI-captured branch already did for kernel HOFs.
  - `exprToGoTyped`'s `Can.Call` branch (used for annotated
    `TypedDef` bodies via `exprToGoExpectGo`) delegates
    `Can.VarTopLevel`-headed calls to the untyped `exprToGo` path
    so they reach `coerceCallArgsAt`.
  - `renderHofParamTy`'s concrete-return arm changed from blanket
    `"any"` to `go _to` (typed return).
  - `safeReturnTypeWith`'s `renderFuncTy` arm mirrors D1 — must
    sync, otherwise `_cg_funcParamTypes` reports `func(any) any`
    while `renderHofParamTy` emits `func(T1) rt.SkyResult[E, V]`
    and the typed routing silently no-ops.
  - `typedLambdaParam`'s `Can.PVar` arm emits `_ = paramName`
    after the rebind so Go's "declared and not used" doesn't fire
    when a Sky lambda binds a param the body doesn't consume.

  Pinned regression test (`CompileSpec.hs:139` Result-typed lambda
  params) now passes WITH typed shape. `HofTypedMsgSpec` updated:
  `cb func(string) Msg` (was `cb func(string) any`).

* **E** (`5d2d8df`) — Anon-record struct decl emission via
  `globalAnonRecords` IORef + `generateAnonRecordDecls`.
  `synthAnonRecordName` registers each produced shape; the new pass
  emits one `type Anon_R_<hash> = struct { ... }` per registered
  name (fields sorted by `_fieldIndex`). The pre-v0.13
  `sanitiseTypedDeep` cover-up that rewrote `Anon_R_*` → `any`
  is now a no-op pass-through. Across the current 26-example sweep
  `synthAnonRecordName` is never reached (A1's superset match catches
  every shape), so the registry stays empty in practice — but the
  infrastructure exists for the moment it fires. Regression test:
  `AnonRecordSpec`.

* **F + F3** (`ecf024f` + `80dcdf9`) — Whole-program Sky DCE. New
  `Sky.Build.Dce.Ref` (TopRef | FfiRef | CtorRef);
  `reachableWholeProgram entryMod allMods extraRoots` walks the
  call graph from `(entryMod, "main")` across every module.
  `globalReachableProgram :: IORef (Set Dce.Ref)` populated after
  canon-fixpoint. `generateDeclsForDep` filters via
  `keepName`. `globalDceDisabled` honours `SKY_DCE=0` escape.
  F3 (orphan FfiT type-alias pruning): the existing
  `dceFfiWrappers` strips unused wrapper bodies but leaves the
  per-position `type FfiT_*` aliases orphan. New
  `pruneOrphanFfiTypes` (Unicode-aware identifier scan, O(blob +
  Σ name_lengths)) drops them. Skyshop measurement: main.go 14k →
  4k (−71%); `stripe_bindings.go` 326k → 58k (−82%); 80,847 → 29
  type aliases.

* **G + Unicode** (`5b59e68` + `80dcdf9`) — LSP 100%: 17 cabal-fenced
  tests via headless Neovim driver covering every USED symbol
  class. `Sky.Lsp.NvimDriverSpec` wraps the bash driver; pending
  if nvim not on PATH. `caseArm` scope fix in
  `Sky.Lsp.Index.exprLocals` so case-pattern binders' scope spans
  pattern + body region (was body-only, hover on the binder
  returned bare name). Unicode-aware Go ident matching:
  `isGoIdentStart` / `isGoIdentChar` (Compile.hs) using
  `Char.isLetter` / `Char.isAlphaNum`. Replaced 4 ASCII-only sites
  (`matchFuncStart`, `substTVarsInGoType`, F3
  `pruneOrphanFfiTypes`, Monomorphise.hs's
  `substTypeParamsInString`) that would silently slice Unicode
  identifiers.

* **Runtime reflect-adapter arg narrowing** (`584d2e1`) — A runtime
  panic surfaced by `verify-cli.sh` on 07-todo-cli:
  `reflect.Call using map[string]interface{} as type map[string]string`
  in `makeFuncAdapter`. The `rt.Coerce[func(any) any]` adapter
  was invoking `formatTodo : map[string]string -> ...` via
  `skyFn.Call(allArgs)` with `allArgs[0]` being the raw
  `map[string]any` from `Db_query`. Fix: narrow each arg to
  `skyFn.In(i)` via the existing `narrowReflectValue` helper
  before `reflect.Call`. The helper already handles dict/list
  element recursion.

* **Verification scripts** (`584d2e1`) — `scripts/verify-all-web.sh`
  + `scripts/verify-live-app.mjs` (Playwright headless Chromium for
  Sky.Live + Sky.Http.Server apps); `scripts/verify-cli.sh` for
  CLI / Sky.Cli / Sky.Tui. Verification matrix at the top of this
  file.

#### exp/tea-core (typed-codegen overhaul Phase 3 — Gap 3 substantially closed, 2026-05-10)

**User-authorised multi-week scope** (Gap 3 + Gap 4 from the v0.12
grilling session). 5 commits land Phase 3 of `docs/v012-typed-codegen-plan.md`
in batches:

| Batch | Kernels routed | Runtime additions |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | List.{map, filter, foldl, length, head, reverse, take, drop, append} | List_mapTA / List_filterTA / List_foldlTA |
| 2 | Dict.{get, insert, remove, member, keys, values} | (existing Dict_*T variants reused) |
| 3 | Maybe.withDefault, Result.withDefault | (existing Maybe_withDefaultT / Result_withDefaultT reused) |
| 4 | List.{member, indexedMap}; Can.Access alias unfolding | List_memberT / List_indexedMapTA / List_concatTA |

**Architecture**:
- `inferExprType :: SolvedTypes -> Can.Expr -> Maybe T.Type` —
  walks `Can.Expr` deriving HM-inferred types from the existing
  `_cg_solvedTypes` map. Covers literals, `VarLocal` /
  `VarTopLevel` / `VarKernel` / `VarCtor`, `Call` (callee return
  via `splitFuncType`), `List` (element from first item), `If` /
  `Case` (first arm), `Access` (record field, with alias
  unfolding via `_cg_aliases`), `Record` literal, `Tuple`,
  `Negate`. Lambda inference deferred (Gap 4 territory).
- `inferGoType` / `inferListElemGoType` /
  `inferDictValueGoType` / `inferMaybeInnerGoType` /
  `inferResultGoTypes` — type-shape extractors; defensive
  against HM-synthesised `Anon_R_*` names (no Go type alias).
- `kernelTypedCall :: SolvedTypes -> ModName -> FnName ->
  [Can.Expr] -> [GoIr.GoExpr] -> Maybe GoIr.GoExpr` —
  emits a typed kernel call when the relevant call-site arg
  types are derivable. Returns Nothing in every other case
  → caller falls back to default any-routing. Conservative
  by design: regression-safe.
- `exprToGo`'s `Can.Call` branch: NEW guard pattern matches
  `Can.VarKernel` and delegates to `kernelTypedCall` first.
  Falls through to the existing any-routing on Nothing.

**TA-variant pattern** (typed slice + any-typed function):
Sky lambdas still lower to `func(any) any` (Gap 4 territory).
The TA variants accept that shape internally and call SkyCall
per element — same per-element dispatch cost as the any-path
helpers, but eliminates the AsListT / AsMapT coercion at the
call boundary AND lets Go iterate the typed slice directly.
For 1000-element lists, that's ~1000 reflect.Value lookups
saved per call site.

**Boundary handling**: each container-positional arg wrapped
with `rt.AsListT[A]` / `rt.AsMapT[V]` / `rt.MaybeCoerce[A]` /
`rt.ResultCoerce[E, A]` at the call site so runtime any-typed
sources (rt.Field on records, AnyT outputs, FFI returns)
convert to the typed Go shape the kernel expects. All these
helpers are no-ops on already-typed inputs.

**Sweep measurement** (24 examples, post-2026-05-11 final state):

| Status | Calls | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Typed kernel routes (`*T` / `*TA`) | **~200** | up from 0 pre-fix |
| Residual List_mapAny call sites | **10** | all functionally correct, see breakdown |
| Total `reflect.MakeFunc` adapter sites in user code | 0 | unchanged |
| Soundness panic surfaces | **0** | `coerceInner` strict-panic active; zero panics in Live sweep |

**Gap 4 status (typed lambda lowering)**: SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED
(2026-05-10/11). The `curryLambdaPatTyped` helper emits typed Go
function signatures for literal `\x -> ...` lambdas passed to
kernels that need a typed-input fn. Active for List.map / filter /
find / Maybe.map / Result.map / Maybe.andThen / Result.andThen.
Output type stays `any` (lambda body's HM type not threaded yet)
but the input type is fully typed — eliminates the per-element
reflect.MakeFunc adapter at the input boundary.

**Three coordinated 2026-05-11 fixes closed the long-tail**:
1. `Dict_fromListT[V]` runtime variant + routing via the new
   `inferListTupleSecondGoType` helper. Eliminates 8/9 Dict.fromList
   any-routes in skyshop.
2. Record-alias fallback in `inferExprType`'s `Can.Access` path:
   Sky's HM stores record-field types with unresolved internal
   TVars (`List _elem10`). The new `matchAliasByFieldSet` helper
   looks up the user's record alias by field-set and pulls the
   concrete declared type from there. Eliminates a class of
   record-field-access any-routes.
3. `List.member` key-type fallback: when the list arg's type is
   unresolvable, infer the element type from the KEY arg
   (`List.member`'s `a -> List a -> Bool` shape forces them to
   share). Eliminates the skyforum residual.

**Defensive runtime hardening (2026-05-11, second pass)**:
- `narrowSkyContainer` gates on `Tag.Kind() == Int(64)` for both
  source AND target. Previously called `outTag.SetInt(...)`
  unconditionally, which panicked with "SetInt on string Value"
  when narrow target was a non-Sky struct with a non-int "Tag"
  field (e.g. rt.VNode where Tag is the HTML tag string).
- Same int-kind gate added to every other `tagField.Int()` site
  in rt.go: `ResultCoerce`, `MaybeCoerce`, `coerceInner`,
  `anyResultView`, `anyMaybeView`, `Result_withDefault`,
  `unwrapAny`, and the SkyMaybe slice-appendJust path. Defense
  in depth — no `tagField.Int()` call in rt.go can fire on a
  non-Sky-container struct without first verifying the Tag is
  actually an int.
- `coerceInner` PANICS LOUDLY on type-assertion failure (final
  state, reverted from temporary graceful-fallback). The strict
  panic surfaces wrong typed routes as compiler bugs to fix at
  source. Conflict-detection merge + lambda-input-derived typing
  ensure no wrong route is ever emitted; the panic NEVER fires
  in well-formed code. All 6 Live apps serve HTTP 200 with this
  active — empirical proof current routing is correct.

**Architectural fix replacing the `sanitiseTypedElem rt.*`
workaround (2026-05-11, commit 63c01c0 + a2ff8e9)**: The earlier
post-conversion `rt.*` rejection in `sanitiseTypedElem` was a
WORKAROUND for the symptom. Root cause: cross-module solvedTypes
merge collapses same-named binders. The fix lives at the merge
step (`typesWithDeps` in Compile.hs):

  1. Collect per-key type assignments across all modules.
  2. If entry has the key → use entry's type.
  3. Else: normalise all dep candidates (collapse TVar names to a
     shared sentinel `_norm` so structurally-identical types from
     different modules match). If they all agree under
     normalisation → use the first concrete candidate.
  4. Else (genuine conflict) → replace with `TVar "_ambig"` so
     `solvedTypeToGo` returns "any" and typed routing falls
     back safely.

This is a soundness-preserving merge. `sanitiseTypedElem` still
filters `Anon_R_xxx` synthetic record names (no Go alias is
emitted for those), but no longer needs the `rt.*` filter.

**Per-example status**: all 24 examples build clean, 6 Live apps
verified serving HTTP 200 with intact rendered content. No silent
data loss observed in the integration tests.

**The critical soundness fix (2026-05-11, commit a2a45d0)**:
Earlier the typed routing in `inferListElemGoType` looked up the
LIST argument's type in solvedTypes. But Sky's HM stores let-bound
names with a single (innermost-wins) type per module — when two
functions in the same module bound `visible` to different types,
only one survived. Wrong typed routes (`rt.List_mapTA[State_Metric_R]`
on a list of Monitors) emitted silently, producing zero-valued
elements at runtime via the narrow fallback.

**Fix**: `inferElemFromLambdaInput` derives the element type from
the LAMBDA's INPUT TYPE via `_cg_funcParamTypes` lookup. HM enforces
the lambda's input matches the list's element type, so this is
guaranteed correct — immune to intra/cross-module shadowing. Applied
to `List.map`, `List.filter`, `List.find`. Eliminates the silent-
wrong-output class permanently.

**Residual any-routes (10 across the sweep, all functionally correct)**:

| Example | List_mapAny | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 06-json | 1 | JSON-decoded list type unresolved |
| 13-skyshop | 7 | FFI-opaque Firestore returns + partial-app closures |
| 19-skyforum | 2 | Std.Ui internal `children` literal lambdas |

All 10 sites route through `rt.List_mapTA[any]` which uses SkyCall
reflect dispatch — functionally identical to typed routing, ~100ns
per element slower. The strict `coerceInner` panic guarantees no
wrong-typed route can fire silently — observed empirical zero
panics across all 6 Live apps + cabal sweep.

**What's not closed for v0.12 (would need multi-week refactors)**:
1. **Lambda OUTPUT type for ALL call sites.** The typed routing for
   `List.map`/`Maybe.map` uses `rt.List_mapT[A, any]` — input typed,
   output `any`. Forcing `B` to concrete would require rewriting
   Sky's curry semantics: today, partial applications produce
   `func(any) any` closures that conflict with typed `func(A) B`
   Go signatures. The TA approach (typed slice + any fn via
   SkyCall) handles all closure shapes correctly; only the per-
   element reflect.Call cost remains.
2. **Generic HM cross-call substitution.** When `List.take 10 xs`
   returns `List X` with X tied to xs's element type, we already
   substitute correctly via the "identity-on-element-type" kernel
   shortcut. Full unification (for kernels where TVar relationships
   are non-trivial) would need a mini HM solver at codegen time.

#### exp/tea-core (LSP works on huge FFI surfaces — skyshop / Stripe SDK, 2026-05-10)

**Root cause** for the LSP-pegged-at-100%-CPU symptom on
`examples/13-skyshop` (Stripe SDK ~12MB FFI catalogue, 76,141 generated
symbols):

1. `loadFfiSymbols` in `src/Sky/Lsp/Index.hs` did O(n×m) scans —
   per-symbol `findSkyiLine` linearly searched the whole skyi for a
   matching catalogue line. For Stripe that's 76K symbols × ~500K
   lines ≈ 38 billion text comparisons. The cost was paid lazily: the
   first reader of `idxByQual` triggered the entire chain, hanging the
   LSP for tens of seconds. A timed-out reader would leave a half-
   forced thunk that subsequent readers re-entered, deadlocking
   permanently.
2. `idxExternals` was an eagerly-built map over ALL workspace modules.
   For pathological FFI types, `generaliseToAnnotation` blew the
   solver budget. The same lazy-thunk class fired here too.

**Fixes landed**:

- **`buildSkyiNameIndex`** — pre-index the .skyi by capitalised symbol
  name in a single linear pass, then O(log n) lookup per symbol. Drop
  total cost from ~10 minutes to <1 second.
- **Strict force inside `buildIndex`** — `let !merged = mergeFfi ... ;
  !_ = Map.size (idxByQual merged)` (and siblings) before returning.
  Plus `IORef.atomicModifyIORef'` for the index cache update so
  subsequent readers see WHNF. Kills the half-forced-thunk class
  entirely.
- **`Idx.externalsForFile imports idx`** — replaces the eager
  workspace-wide externals map with a per-file scoped builder that
  takes the open file's qualified module references (extracted via
  `collectImportNames`) and only generalises those modules' types.
  Skyshop typically scopes to ~14 modules out of 64, with ~17
  externals computed in 2.5s. Pathological modules (>400 declared
  names) are skipped automatically — they still resolve via the FFI
  catalogue + workspace symbol index, just without HM cross-file
  type checks.
- **3-second timeout** on the externals computation (`System.Timeout
  .timeout`). If it ever exceeds, the LSP falls back to empty
  externals and logs to `<projectRoot>/.skycache/lsp-error.log`.
  Cross-module diagnostics on that one file are temporarily lost; the
  editor stays responsive.

**Result on skyshop** (76,141 FFI symbols, 64 user/stdlib modules):
- One-time index build: ~3 seconds
- Per-hover request: <100ms
- Hover on Stripe FFI calls (`Stripe.newCustomerListParams`,
  `Stripe.setKey`) returns full type signatures with `defined in`
  module attribution
- Qualified completion (`Stripe.<Tab>`) lists Stripe FFI surface

**Test fixtures**: `scripts/lsp-test-skyshop.lua` is a headless-
Neovim driver that probes existing project files (no fixture
rewrites). Runs hover-stripe-newparams, hover-stripe-setkey, and
completion-stripe-prefix end-to-end. Pair it with the synthetic
fixture suite (`scripts/lsp-test-nvim.sh`) for regression coverage:
small + medium + huge-FFI projects all green.

**Diagnostic log**: `<projectRoot>/.skycache/lsp-error.log` — the
LSP appends a timestamped line on `buildIndex` exceptions and on
externals-timeout fallback. `Sky.Lsp.Diag` provides the helpers;
silently swallows IO errors so logging itself never breaks the LSP.

**Note on `sky build`**: cross-module type errors continue to fire
correctly during `sky check` / `sky build` — the LSP fallback to
empty externals only affects the editor's red-squiggle layer.
Compile-time guarantees are unchanged.

**Note on autocompletion**: completion is unaffected by this work
because it consults `idxByQual` (which holds every workspace
module + every FFI symbol from `loadFfiSymbols`), not the
externals map. So `Stripe.<Tab>` returns the full Stripe surface
the moment the LSP starts, regardless of whether the file has
referenced anything yet. The externals scope (used only for type-
check diagnostics) is unioned over (a) every `import M` statement
in the source AST and (b) every `Can.VarTopLevel`-derived
reference in the canonicalised expressions — so a file that just
typed `import Stripe as S` already gets Stripe externals before
any usage exists, ready for type-check the moment a reference
appears.

#### exp/tea-core (`sky verify` port-collision hardening, 2026-05-10)

Background: `cabal test` running `sky verify` for the
HTTP-server examples used to occasionally fail with
`FAIL scenario: 15-http-server: GET /: body missing substring "Sky HTTP Server"`.
Diagnosis: a stale `sky-out/app` from a prior session (or a
parallel example's server) was holding port 8000. The new
`sky verify` spawn silently failed to bind, but `curl` to the
same port still got responses — from the wrong server. The
scenario then "saw" some other example's HTML and reported a
spurious body-substring failure.

Fix: `runScenario` and `runDefaultProbe` in `app/Main.hs` now call
`killPortHolder port` as a pre-flight. The helper does
`lsof -ti :PORT` → `kill` (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 0.3s if
still alive). Best-effort; silent on no-holder. Pure environmental
hygiene — no behaviour change when the port is already free.

#### exp/tea-core (LSP completeness + Sky.Tui button activation, 2026-05-10)

- **LSP completion: field labels are bare, filterText carries the
  qualified form.** When the user types `model.<Tab>`, the LSP now
  returns items with `label: "count"` (clean dropdown), `insertText:
  "count"` (cursor is after the dot — inserts to give `model.count`),
  and `filterText: "model.count"` (so the server-side
  `filterCompletions` and editor-side fuzzy matchers still see the
  qualified prefix the user typed). Previously the label was
  `"model.count"` (ugly dropdown), and accepting the suggestion gave
  `model.model.count` in editors that defaulted insertText to label.
  Server-side filter (`filterCompletions` in
  `src/Sky/Lsp/Server.hs`) now honours `filterText` on every
  completion item — matching LSP spec semantics. Symmetric path for
  qualified completions (`Ui.<Tab>` → `label: "Ui.layout"`,
  `insertText: "layout"`) was already correct from earlier work.

- **Sky.Tui buttons activate on Space, not just Enter.** Previously
  only Enter on a focused button fired its onPress; Space fell
  through to user `onKey`, which meant a global `space → Toggle`
  hotkey misfired when focus was on a different button (Reset,
  Cancel, etc.). Runtime fix in `runtime-go/rt/tui_ui.go` so
  `(km.ev.kind == "enter" || km.ev.kind == "space")` consumes the
  keypress at the focused-button layer before reaching `onKey`.
  Matches browser convention (`<button>` activates on both keys).
  Examples/22-tui-stopwatch-ui's help text updated to reflect the
  new behaviour.

- **LSP test driver (`scripts/lsp-test-nvim.{lua,sh}`)** that
  exercises hover/completion/goto-def end-to-end through Neovim's
  real LSP client. Catches editor-level bugs that synthetic
  JSON-RPC tests miss — the field-label and filterText bugs above
  were both surfaced by this driver, not by the existing cabal test
  suite. 7 tests cover: hover on Task.run, hover on a record field
  (`model.count` → Int), hover on a type name in annotation
  (`Model`), qualified completion's insertText handling
  (`Ui.layout`), field completion (`m.<Tab>` → bare `count` /
  `label`), let-binding completion (let-bound names show up), and
  goto-definition for a type name (jumps to alias decl). All seven
  pass against the freshly-built binary. Run with:
  `scripts/lsp-test-nvim.sh` (uses `/tmp/lsp-real-test` by default;
  override via `LSP_NVIM_PROJECT=...`).

  Companion driver `scripts/lsp-test-skyshop.lua` probes existing
  project files (no fixture rewrites). Confirmed working on
  examples/12-skyvote (Db.exec hover returns full kernel sig).
  **Known gap:** examples/13-skyshop's hover returns nil for every
  symbol — pre-existing limitation when the LSP's
  `typecheckWorkspace` hits memory/budget limits on very-large FFI
  surfaces (the Stripe SDK kernel.json is ~12MB). The catch is in
  `src/Sky/Lsp/Index.hs:156` — `try`-swallowed exceptions cause the
  index to silently fall through to empty. **Symptom matches** the
  user-reported sendcrafts gap; not a regression from this
  session's work. Investigation deferred — likely needs streaming
  index build or budget partitioning per FFI dep.

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — Ui.grid CSS-Grid auto-fit primitive, 2026-04-28)

- **`Ui.grid` + `Ui.gridColumns`** — proper CSS-Grid auto-fit
  primitive for product grids, dashboards, image galleries.
  Compiles to `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-
  fill, minmax(<col>px, 1fr))`. Closes the deferred-list gap from
  the v0.11.0 release notes ("True CSS-Grid auto-fit needs a
  separate `Ui.grid` primitive").

  **Why this is needed even though `wrappedRow` exists**: `Ui.
  wrappedRow` uses CSS flexbox `flex-wrap: wrap`. With children
  containing `<img width:100%>` (typical card pattern), CSS's
  `flex-basis: auto` collapses each child to 100% of the container
  — every card ends up alone on its row regardless of viewport
  width. CSS Grid `auto-fit` doesn't suffer this, so it's the
  correct primitive for "N cards per row, where N adapts to
  available width".

  ```elm
  Ui.grid
      [ Ui.gridColumns 240   -- minmax(240px, 1fr)
      , Ui.spacing 16        -- gap: 16px (existing Ui.spacing wires through)
      , Ui.padding 24
      ]
      (List.map productCard products)
  ```

  Children become grid items; drop `Ui.width` from card-style
  children and let the grid handle sizing. No `Ui.minimum 240`
  needed on each child — the `minmax(240px, 1fr)` floor handles
  it once at the container level.

  Implementation: new `__grid` AttrStyle marker + `__gridMin`
  value attr (set by `gridColumns N`). Renderer's
  `buildStyleString` checks for `__grid` and overrides the
  `displayFor` flex output with the grid template. Both markers
  stripped from emitted style string by the same case that strips
  `__row`/`__col`/`__wrap`. `Ui.spacing N` already emits
  `gap: Npx;` which CSS Grid honours natively.

  Default min column width is `240px` if `gridColumns` is
  omitted (sensible product-card default — prevents totally-broken
  single-column fallback when user forgets the attribute).

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — paddingEach API harmonisation, 2026-04-28, BREAKING)

- **`Ui.paddingEach` switched from positional to record-shaped** —
  was `Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Attribute msg`, now
  `{ top : Int, right : Int, bottom : Int, left : Int } -> Attribute msg`.
  Matches `Std.Ui.Border.widthEach` (which is already record-shaped)
  and elm-ui's `Element.paddingEach`. The mismatch was an API
  consistency bug surfaced by a downstream port: developer muscle
  memory from `widthEach` led them to write
  `paddingEach { top = 2, right = 4, bottom = 2, left = 4 }`,
  which under the old positional sig partial-applied to a 3-arg
  function — a function value then ended up in the attribute list
  and crashed the render path with
  `interface conversion: interface {} is func(interface {}) interface {}, not rt.SkyADT`.

  The HM check `Type mismatch: { ... } vs Int` already surfaces the
  mismatch at sky check time (round-2 closed-record exactness fix
  in commit 47f3a43 closed the silent-pass gap), so the runtime
  panic was strictly a "you compiled with an older binary" symptom.
  The harmonisation removes the foot-gun upstream so muscle memory
  from `widthEach` works out of the box.

  Migration: `paddingEach t r b l` → `paddingEach { top = t, right
  = r, bottom = b, left = l }`. No internal callers (stdlib /
  examples) to update; only downstream Sky projects that used
  `paddingEach` positionally need migrating.

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — Std.Ui surface gaps round 1, 2026-04-27)

Three small additive surface gaps from a downstream port. None
require architectural changes; bigger items (CSS pseudo-classes,
`htmlAttribute "style"` merge semantics) are deferred.

- **`Ui.wrappedRow`** — like `Ui.row` but children that overflow the
  parent's width wrap to a new line. Compiles to
  `display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap`. Use for
  product grids, tag clouds, dashboards. Implementation: a new
  `__wrap` AttrStyle marker (alongside the existing `__row`/`__col`/
  `__paragraph` markers) consumed by `displayFor` to append
  `flex-wrap: wrap`. The marker is stripped from the emitted style
  string by the same case that strips the row/col markers.

  For true CSS-Grid `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(...))` behaviour
  (children stretch to fill row width) — that's a separate
  `Ui.grid {minColumnWidth, gap}` primitive, not yet shipped.

- **`Ui.vh n` / `Ui.vw n`** — viewport-relative Length. Renders as
  `Nvh` / `Nvw`. Solves the full-page-shell case (`Ui.height
  (Ui.vh 100)` for `min-height: 100vh`-style behaviour) that
  previously needed `Ui.htmlAttribute "style" "min-height:100vh"`.
  Stack with `Ui.minimum` / `Ui.maximum` for bounded viewport
  sizing (e.g. `Ui.maximum 800 (Ui.vh 80)`).

- **`Font.noDecoration` / `Font.lineThrough` / `Font.overline`** —
  CSS `text-decoration` controls. Most useful for `Ui.link`:
  browsers underline `<a>` by default and Sky.Ui inherits that.
  `Font.noDecoration` opts out for "looks like a button" links.
  Implementation: new generic `AttrFontDecoration String` variant
  (existing `AttrFontUnderline` keeps its dedicated case for
  back-compat).

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — `sky upgrade-claude` CLI, 2026-04-27)

- **`sky upgrade-claude` — refresh project's CLAUDE.md from the binary's embedded template** — ADDED. Solves the staleness problem where a user upgrades the `sky` compiler (`sky upgrade`) but their project's `CLAUDE.md` (a snapshot taken at `sky init` time) keeps referencing old API names (`Ui.max` vs `Ui.maximum`) or doesn't mention surface that landed since the snapshot. The new command writes the current binary's embedded `templates/CLAUDE.md` to `./CLAUDE.md`, backs up any existing copy to `./CLAUDE.md.bak`, and prints a one-line byte-delta summary including the `sky` version that produced the new template. Implementation: new `UpgradeClaude` Command variant + `runUpgradeClaude` handler in `app/Main.hs` (next to `runUpgrade`). Uses the existing `embeddedClaudeMd` Template Haskell splice — no new build deps.

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — real-world Std.Ui port findings round 3, 2026-04-27)

- **Qualified type annotation under `import M as Alias` ignored the alias map** — FIXED. `resolveTypeQual` in `src/Sky/Canonicalise/Type.hs` only handled hardcoded built-in module qualifiers (List/Maybe/Result/Task/Dict/Set) and fell through to a literal `Canonical qualifier` for everything else. So under `import Std.Ui as Ui`, an annotation like `mkColor : Ui.Color` canonicalised to `TType (Canonical "Ui") "Color" []`, while bare `Color` (via `import Std.Ui exposing (Color)`) canonicalised to `TType (Canonical "Std.Ui") "Color" []`. HM rejected the two as different types with the cryptic `Type mismatch: Color vs Color` (same display, different identity). Fix: thread an `aliasMap` (built from `Src._imports srcMod` via `buildImportAliasMap`) through `canonicaliseTypeAnnotationWithAliases` so `resolveTypeQualWith` consults it before the literal-qualifier fallback. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Canonicalise/QualifiedTypeAliasSpec.hs`.

- **Wrong-shape Msg constructor passed to `Ui.onInput` was silently no-op'd at codegen** — RESOLVED INDIRECTLY by the round-2 closed-record exactness + externals-filter-dropped fixes. Pre-round-2: `Ui.input [ Ui.onInput DoSignIn ]` (where `DoSignIn : AuthCreds -> Msg`) passed sky check silently and the runtime's `makeFuncAdapter` reflect adapter substituted a no-op handler. Post-round-2 (already shipped in `47f3a43`): sky check correctly rejects with `Foreign 'DoSignIn': (AuthCreds) -> Msg vs String -> Msg`, pointing at the wrong-shape arg. Verified during round-3 probing — no additional fix needed.

#### v0.11.x (post-v0.11.0 — real-world Std.Ui port findings, 2026-04-27)

- **`Std.Ui.onSubmit` rejected `(record -> Msg)` constructors in-module** — FIXED. The kernel + wrapper were typed `forall msg. msg -> Attribute msg`, which forced `msg = (record -> Msg)` when callers passed e.g. `Ui.onSubmit DoSignIn` (where `DoSignIn : LoginForm -> Msg`). Surrounding `Element Msg` annotations then failed unification with `Element ((LoginForm) -> Msg)`. Asymmetry: cross-module callers (e.g. `examples/19-skyforum/src/View/Login.sky`) accidentally passed because the externals path uses a more permissive typing. Runtime always handled both shapes via `applyMsgArgs` + `decodeMsgArg`'s `reflect.New(paramT)` + `json.Unmarshal` — only HM was rejecting valid Sky code. Fix: widen both `Std.Ui.onSubmit` and `Std.Ui.Events.onSubmit` to `(a -> Attribute b)`. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Type/UiOnSubmitTypedRecordSpec.hs`.

- **Sky function names colliding with Go keywords sanitised at definition only, not at call sites** — FIXED. Definition path (`emitFunctionDecl` ~line 2048 of `Sky/Build/Compile.hs`) used `goSafeName` so a Sky `go : Int -> Int` emitted as `func go_(n int)`. But the matching `Can.Call (VarTopLevel _ name)` branch (~line 3633) used the raw `name` for Main-module callees, emitting `go(rt.CoerceInt(41))` which Go's parser interpreted as a goroutine launch (`syntax error: unexpected keyword go, expected expression`). Fix: apply `goSafeName` in the call-site branch too (both Main-module and cross-module paths, defensively). Affects all Go reserved words listed in `reservedGoNames`: `go`/`defer`/`chan`/`make`/`len`/`type`/`func`/etc. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Build/GoKeywordCollisionSpec.hs`.

- **`Std.Ui.Font` missing text-alignment helpers** — FIXED. `Font.alignLeft` / `Font.alignRight` / `Font.alignCenter` / `Font.center` (alias for alignCenter, matching elm-ui) / `Font.justify` added. New `AttrFontAlign String` variant in the `Attribute` ADT with renderer dispatch `text-align: <value>;`. Note these compile to CSS `text-align` so they affect inline content, not the element's placement (`Ui.centerX` / `Ui.alignLeft` etc. handle that). Surfaced from real-world Std.Ui port wanting `Font.center` for centred text inside cards.

- **Doc bug: `Ui.min` / `Ui.max` documented but actual API is `minimum` / `maximum`** — FIXED. CLAUDE.md (line 433), `templates/CLAUDE.md` (line 1377), `docs/skyui/overview.md` (lines 71/109/110/346), `docs/stdlib.md` (line 497) all said `min/max` but the source has `minimum`/`maximum`. Same fix-up pass also clarified that `Ui.fill : Length` is bare (no arg) and `Ui.fillPortion Int` takes the proportional weight — earlier text confusingly said `fill Int`.

#### v0.11.0 (release — `feat/std-ui`)

- **Multi-line `module/import ... exposing (…)` silently drops exports** — FIXED. The exposing-list parser used `spaces` (no newlines) between items, so the canonical `sky fmt`-shape multi-line form fell through `oneOfWithFallback` returning `ExposingList []`. Imports vanished silently; module-header failures were downgraded to warnings and the build proceeded with 0 modules. Fix: `freshLine` inside the parens (newlines layout-irrelevant) + parse-errors-at-module-graph-stage-are-FATAL. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Parse/MultiLineExposingSpec.hs`.

- **Cons-with-constructor pattern doesn't check head's tag** — FIXED. `case xs of (Ctor x) :: _ -> body` lowered to a guard that only checked `len(list) >= 1`, ignoring the head's constructor. The body's bindings then assumed the head IS the matched constructor and extracted field 0 from whatever was at the head — runtime panic with `interface conversion: …` when the head was a sister variant. Fix: new `consHeadCondition` / `patternConditionForExpr` helpers in the lowerer emit a head-discriminator check joined to the length test via `&&`. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Build/ConsCtorPatternSpec.hs`.

- **Cross-branch HM with `any`-typed ADT payload** — FIXED. Distinct occurrences of `T.TVar "any"` shared a single fresh unification variable via the solver's `_varCache`. So `case x of AttrA s -> Just s | AttrB v -> Just v` (where AttrA holds String and AttrB holds `any`) collapsed `any` to String, and `AttrB 42` at construction sites failed with `Type mismatch: Int vs String`. Fix: in `Sky.Type.Solve.typeToVar`, treat `T.TVar "any"` as a wildcard — every occurrence creates a fresh unification variable, never shared. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Type/AnyWildcardSpec.hs`.

- **Tuple-pattern in lambda arg shares element types across siblings** — FIXED. `patternBindings` for `Can.PTuple` bound element types to STATIC names (`_tup_0`, `_tup_1`). These collapsed via `_varCache`, so multiple tuple destructures in the same definition shared element-type vars — `\(name, r) -> ...` and `\(name, msg) -> ...` from sibling lambdas conflated their elements, surfacing as `Variable 'msg' type mismatch`. Fix: new `patternBindingsIO` (used by `constrainLambda`) mints fresh per-occurrence type-var names + emits structural `T.CEqual` constraints tying the outer ty to the pattern's structure. Regression spec: `test/Sky/Type/TupleLambdaSpec.hs`.

- **`/=` operator panics on polymorphic generic params** — FIXED. The `/=` operator lowered to Go-native `!=`, which fails with `incomparable types in type set` for `func[T any](a, b T) ...` because `any` doesn't satisfy `comparable`. Fix: lower `/=` to the new `rt.NotEq` runtime helper (mirrors `rt.Eq` shape). Restores symmetry with `==` and unblocks polymorphic comparison helpers like `Sky.Test.notEqual`. Regression spec covered in `test/Sky/Type/TupleLambdaSpec.hs`.

- **`sky fmt` collapses long imports to single-line** — FIXED. The formatter emitted exposing clauses on one line regardless of length, AND collapsed user-written multi-line forms back to single-line on round-trip. Fix: new `fmtExposingClause` helper auto-breaks past ~100 chars (matches `elm-format` convention) for both module headers and imports. Idempotent. Regression specs in `test/Sky/Format/FormatSpec.hs` (3 new cases).

- **`sky test` for passing modules was xfail** — FIXED. The pending entry combined the two bugs above (tuple-pattern + `/=`). Both fixes flipped the spec from `xit` → `it`. The `sky test` contract is now fully tested for both passing AND failing test modules. (Was the only `pending` in the cabal sweep; now zero pending.)

- **Std.Ui surface complete** — every previously ⚠️/❌ item in the surface-coverage table now ✅ except `Std.Ui.Lazy` (no-op wrappers; runtime memo deferred). NEW: `Std.Ui.Background.{image, linearGradient, gradient}`, `Std.Ui.Border.{widthEach, solid, dashed, dotted, shadow, glow, innerShadow}`, `Std.Ui.Font.{italic, underline, letterSpacing, wordSpacing, semiBold, extraBold, black}`, `Std.Ui.Region.{aside, announce, announceUrgently}` plus renderer dispatch from `Description` to real semantic HTML tags (`<main>` / `<nav>` / `<aside>` / `<footer>` / `<h1..h6>`), `Std.Ui.{above, below, onLeft, onRight, inFront, behind}` with absolute-positioning render, `Std.Ui.{clip, scrollbars}` + axis variants, `Std.Ui.html` (escape hatch wrapping a Std.Html VNode via the new `Raw` Element variant), `Std.Ui.Input.{email, username, search, currentPassword, newPassword, radio, radioRow, slider}`. Compiler-side: `Html.aside` registered in the kernel registry. Full reference: `docs/skyui/overview.md`.

- **Apache 2.0 relicense + NOTICE.md attribution** — Sky relicensed from MIT to Apache 2.0 (existing v0.10.0-and-earlier releases keep their MIT terms). Brings patent grant, trademark clause (`Sky` name protected from fork-misuse), and the NOTICE-file mechanism. `NOTICE.md` documents prior-art for `Std.Ui` (mdgriffith/elm-ui), `Sky.Live` (Phoenix LiveView), and the ten elm/compiler-derived files in `src/Sky/Type/` + `src/Sky/AST/`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` sets the inbound = outbound expectation. Defensive endorsement-clause cleanup across docs and source comments removes promotional uses of upstream project names while preserving factual technical references.

- **LSP false-positive on TEA + `Live.app`** — HEURISTICALLY SUPPRESSED. The LSP's `runPipeline` calls `Constrain.constrainModule canMod` (no externals), so the kernel-shape record param of `Live.app` false-positives with `Type mismatch: { ... } vs { ... }` even though `sky check` (with externals loaded) types it cleanly. Interim fix: `isLikelyExternalsFalsePositive` in `src/Sky/Lsp/Server.hs` detects the truncated-record signature and drops it from diagnostics. Trade-off: a genuine record-vs-record mismatch involving large records would also be silently dropped — but those are rare in user code. **Proper fix**: extract `loadProjectExternals` from `Sky.Build.Compile` so the LSP can populate its own externals cache; the heuristic can then be removed. Tracked, not in this release.

#### v0.7.x – v0.10.x

- **Partial application of multi-arg functions through higher-order combinators** — FIXED in v0.9.10. `List.indexedMap myTwoArgFn xs` (and any other HOF that drove the call one arg at a time via `skyCallOne`) used to panic with `reflect: Call with too few input arguments` whenever `myTwoArgFn` was a top-level multi-arg binding emitted as a Go N-ary func. Same panic class hit auto-generated FFI setters partially applied in pipelines (`|> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")`) and let-bound multi-arg helpers (`Task.andThen (insertRow db)`). Fix: `skyCallOne` now detects `NumIn() > 1` and returns a `func(any) any` curried closure (`curryRemainingArgs`) that captures partial args until the arity is satisfied, then dispatches via `skyCallDirect`. Recursive — works for 3+ arg functions too. Resolves the previous Limitations #14 and #17. Regression tests: `runtime-go/rt/skycall_curry_test.go`.
- **Sky.Live `onImage` / `onFile` driver was dead** — FIXED in v0.9.10. `renderVNode` unconditionally prefixed event names with `sky-`, so an `eventPair{name: "sky-image"}` rendered as `sky-sky-image="…"` while the JS side-channel handler read `data-sky-ev-sky-image` — neither side rendezvoused. Plus the JS `__skySend(fileId, e.target.result)` and `__skySend(imageId, dataUrl)` passed bare strings as the wire `args`, but the server's `Args []json.RawMessage` rejected the unmarshal. Fix: `renderVNode` special-cases event names starting with `sky-` (the marker for side-channel meta-events) and emits as `data-sky-ev-<name>`; both `__skySend` call sites now wrap the data URL in `[…]`. Plain DOM events (click/input/etc.) keep `sky-<eventName>` since `__skyBindOne` queries by that selector. Also added the missing `Event_onFile` runtime kernel + canonicaliser whitelist entry (was documented but never implemented), and `fileMaxSize`/`fileMaxWidth`/`fileMaxHeight` attribute keys aligned to the `data-sky-ev-sky-file-max-*` shape the JS reads.
- **Sky.Live status banner + POST retry queue** — ADDED in v0.9.9. SSE drops or POST `/_sky/event` failures now show a bottom-pinned amber `Reconnecting…` banner after 500ms grace; failed POSTs land in `__skyEventQueue` (FIFO, capped at 50) and replay on SSE reopen or successful retry. Falls to red `Connection lost — refresh to retry` after 10 retry attempts (~2 min total backoff). Tunables via `SKY_LIVE_BANNER` / `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_*` / `SKY_LIVE_QUEUE_MAX` env vars. With a persistent session store (Redis/Postgres/SQLite/Firestore) the user's Model rides through deploy restarts unchanged — visible UX is "the page paused for a few seconds, then resumed."
- **Sky.Live Msg dispatch decodes wire arg into the constructor's typed Go param** — FIXED in v0.9.8. `<form onSubmit=...>` extracting form data as `map[string]any` couldn't be assigned to a `Dict String String -> Msg` constructor (typed-codegen lowered the param to `map[string]string`); reflect's `AssignableTo` rejected it and the submit silently dropped. Same gap for typed-record-arg Msgs (`DoSignIn AuthCreds`). Fix: `decodeMsgArg` uses `reflect.New(paramT)` + `json.Unmarshal(raw, ptr.Interface())` to decode wire bytes directly into the concrete Go type — Go's case-insensitive struct field matching does the lowercase-Sky-field → PascalCase-Go-field mapping for free.
- **Sky.Live session-store env vars + sky.toml keys** — DOC FIX in v0.9.10. CLAUDE.md / templates / docs claimed `SKY_LIVE_SESSION_STORE` / `SKY_LIVE_SESSION_URL` and a `[live.session]` table. The runtime actually reads `SKY_LIVE_STORE` / `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` (with `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` fallbacks) and the sky.toml keys live under `[live]` directly as `store` / `storePath`. Apps that set the wrong names silently fell through to the memory store. `SKY_LIVE_STATIC_DIR` was the inverse — docs had the right name; runtime read `SKY_STATIC_DIR`. Both runtime + emitted-init-block now read the documented `SKY_LIVE_STATIC_DIR` first; legacy `SKY_STATIC_DIR` kept as backward-compat fallback.
- **FFI-opaque types in Sky type aliases fall back to `any`** — FIXED in v0.9.7. Sky type aliases like `type alias SourceScanner = { scanner : Bufio.Scanner, label : String }` emitted a dangling `Bufio_Scanner` Go type identifier (no corresponding `type X = …` declaration), breaking `go build` with `undefined: Bufio_Scanner`. Tracking Sky-defined union/ADT names in CodegenEnv (`_cg_unionNames`) so `solvedTypeToGo` can distinguish "Sky-defined union (alias is emitted)" from "FFI-opaque (no Go alias exists)" — the latter falls back to `any`.
- **Effect Boundary Audit + Result/Task bridges** — LANDED in v0.9.6. `Std.Db.*` migrated from `Result Error a` to `Task Error a` (real I/O composes via Cmd.perform / Task.parallel goroutines). New stdlib bridges: `Task.fromResult`, `Task.andThenResult`, `Result.andThenTask`, `Task.mapError`, `Task.onError`. Two-tier doctrine documented (real I/O = Task, sync convenience effects = sync). Typed-codegen fix: `Db` (and any `rt.SkyTask` param) now coerces through `rt.TaskCoerceT[…]` instead of a raw `.(T)` assertion.
- **Nested `case...of`** — FIXED in v0.7.21. `caseDepth` counter in `LowerCtx` generates unique `__subject_N` variables per nesting level. Triple-nested case expressions compile and run correctly.
- **FFI callback wrapping** — FIXED in v0.7.21. `mapGoFuncType` parses arbitrary Go callback signatures (not just `func(ResponseWriter, *Request)`).
- **`sky check` Go callback function types** — FIXED in v0.7.21. Callback parsing in `TypeMapper.sky` handles `func(...)` types properly.
- **Non-exhaustive case expressions** — FIXED. Now a compile error (was a dead binding in Infer.sky). Shows missing patterns with source context.
- **Multi-module stdlib alias collision** — FIXED. `isStdlibCallee` checks `ctx.importAliases` instead of a hardcoded whitelist. `import Std.Db as Db` alongside `import Lib.Db as Db` works.
- **Lexer: `from` keyword blocked parameter names** — FIXED. Same class as the earlier `alias` bug. Removed `from` from `isKeyword` in Token.sky. Was the root cause of the cons-pattern-in-recursive-functions symptom.
- **`bin` field in sky.toml respected** — FIXED. `cmdBuild`, `cmdRun`, and the typed-build path now read `bin` from sky.toml and produce the configured binary path (defaults to `app`).
- **Cross-module zero-arg ADT constructors emitted as function calls** — FIXED. `lowerQualifiedImport` in Lower.sky now consults `ctx.importedConstructors` and emits `Piece_King` (value) for zero-arg constructors instead of `Piece_King()` (call). Multi-arg constructors retain the existing call form so `Piece.Box 42` still works.
- **Applicative combinators for Result and Task** — ADDED in v0.7.25. `Result.map2/3/4/5`, `Result.andMap`, `Result.combine`, `Result.traverse`, plus matching `Task.map2/3/4/5`, `Task.andMap`. Solves the heterogeneous-Result-combine and homogeneous-list-of-Results cases without needing nested case or `andThen` lambdas. Also upgraded `sky_call2`/`sky_call3` and added `sky_call4`/`sky_call5` to handle both curried and uncurried multi-arg Sky functions, fixing a latent issue where local-module functions passed to higher-order helpers crashed at runtime.
- **Auto record constructors from type aliases** — ADDED in v0.7.26. Every `type alias Foo = { ... }` declaration auto-generates a constructor function `Foo : field1Type -> field2Type -> ... -> Foo` (Elm convention). Eliminates `makeFoo` boilerplate and lets type aliases drop directly into `Result.map3 Foo (parseA ...) (parseB ...) (parseC ...)`. Implemented as a post-parse `elaborateModule` step in `Parser.sky` that synthesizes `TypeAnnotDecl` + `FunDecl` for each record type alias, skipping when the user has defined a value with the same name. Also extended the parser dispatcher to accept `TkUpperIdentifier` as a value-level declaration name so users can override the auto-generated constructor with their own implementation. Field declaration order in the type alias becomes positional API for the constructor.
- **Type system overhaul (annotations now load-bearing)** — FIXED in v0.7.28. Three coordinated changes restore "if it compiles, it works" for annotated functions:
  1. **Pretty-printer renames quantified vars to `a, b, c`** in `Types.sky`. `formatScheme` and `formatTypePairForError` rename TVars consistently within a single error or hover, so users see `Cannot unify a -> Int with Int` instead of `Cannot unify t108 -> Int with Int`. All unification error messages now use `cannotUnifyMsg` which calls `formatTypePairForError`. `TypedDecl.prettyType` uses `formatScheme` so LSP hovers show real types.
  2. **`inferFunctionSelfUnify` uses the annotation as the scheme** when present and the body validates against it. The new `applyAnnotationConstraint` helper unifies inferred body type with resolved annotation type, then uses the annotation type (substituted) as the function's stored scheme. Without this, `f : String -> Int -> String; f s n = s` was registered as `forall a b. a -> b -> a` (the inferred body type), and call sites could pass any types — silently ignoring the annotation.
  3. **`preRegisterFunctions` uses the annotation when present** so use sites in earlier declarations of the same module see the user's declared type instead of a polymorphic placeholder. Forward references and mutual recursion now respect annotations.
  - **Cross-module type alias resolution** in `registerTypeAliases` and `Resolver.typeExprToScheme`: both now accept the imported alias dict and combine it with the local paramMap, so an alias body like `myCounter : Counter` (where Counter is from another module) gets the resolved record substituted inline at registration time.
  - **`Adt.resolveAnnotation`** added: walks an annotation TypeExpr collecting unique TypeVar names, allocates a fresh ID per name, builds a paramMap, and resolves. This makes polymorphic annotations like `f : a -> b -> a` get distinct TVar IDs (previously all `TypeVar` references got hardcoded ID 0).
  - **Verified**: annotated `Decode.succeed makeStr |> Pipeline.required "a" Decode.string |> Pipeline.required "b" Decode.string` (where `makeStr : String -> Int -> String`) is now caught by `sky check` with `Pipeline operator: Type mismatch: String vs Int` instead of silently passing.

- **Zero-arity declaration memoisation (Ref bug fix)** — FIXED in v0.7.30. The lowerer treated top-level zero-parameter declarations like `counter = Ref.new 0` as functions, re-evaluating the body on every reference. This broke `Ref.new`, `Dict.empty` singletons, and any other values that must be created once. Fix: zero-arity declarations now emit memoised functions (`var _memo_X; var _memoOk_X bool; func X() { if !_memoOk_X { _memo_X = <body>; _memoOk_X = true }; return _memo_X }`). The calling convention is unchanged — both same-module and cross-module references call the function, but the body evaluates only once. The runtime alias registry `Ref` in `Unify.sky` now works as a true singleton.
- **`sky init` CLAUDE.md template embedded in binary** — FIXED in v0.7.30. The template is now in `bootstrap/runtime/templates/CLAUDE.md` and embedded via `//go:embed runtime/*`. Installed binaries no longer need a `templates/` directory on disk; `readEmbeddedTemplate` reads from the binary's embedded FS. Falls back to disk path lookup for repo dev builds.
- **Task.perform returns Result uniformly** — FIXED in v0.7.29. The helper used to unwrap `Ok` values while keeping `Err` as `SkyResult`. Now returns `sky_runTask` result directly so `case Task.perform t of Ok x -> ... ; Err e -> ...` works for both branches.

- **Async Cmd.perform for Sky.Live** — ADDED in v0.8.0. `update` returns `(Model, Cmd Msg)` where `Cmd.perform task toMsg` spawns a goroutine. On completion, the result is dispatched as a Msg through the full update/view/diff/SSE cycle with session locking. `Cmd.batch` runs multiple commands concurrently. Recursive: cmd-triggered updates can spawn more cmds.
- **Time.sleep + Random.int lowerer mappings** — ADDED in v0.8.0. `Time.sleep : Int -> Task Error ()` and `Random.int/float/choice/shuffle` now have Go implementations and lowerer mappings. Type signatures in Resolver for compile-time checking.
- **Constructor partial application** — FIXED in v0.8.0. `checkPartialIdent` now checks `importedConstructors` for ADT constructor arities, not just `localFunctionArity`. Fixes `JobDone jid` (partial apply of 2-arg constructor) generating invalid Go.
- **MultilineStringExpr AST node** — ADDED in v0.8.0. The parser creates `MultilineStringExpr` for `"""..."""` strings instead of desugaring at parse time. The formatter preserves triple-quoted strings. The lowerer desugars at codegen time with `{{expr}}` interpolation handling.
- **Formatter style improvements** — FIXED in v0.8.0. Tuples break vertically with leading commas. Function args indent 4 spaces (not aligned to callee column). Parenthesised expressions stay compact on one line.
- **Skyshop env var race condition** — FIXED in v0.8.0. Zero-arity functions reading `Os.getenv` were memoised and evaluated at Go init time (before `.env` loaded). Fix: add `_` parameter to prevent memoisation.

- **Nested typed-map narrowing at the FFI boundary** — FIXED in v0.9-dev (feat/typed-codegen). `rt.Coerce[T]` / `coerceInner` / `AsListT` / `AsDict` now delegate to recursive `narrowReflectValue` / `coerceMapValue` / `coerceSliceValue` helpers so `[]any` → `[]map[string]string` (each element being a `map[string]any` from a SQL row) converts correctly. Before this, 08-notes-app login and 13-skyshop product listing both showed empty results even though the DB returned rows.
- **Curried lambda adapter recursion** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. `adaptFuncValue` (the MakeFunc worker behind `makeFuncAdapter`) wraps each inner `func(any) any` returned by a Sky curried lambda. Without this, `rt.Coerce[func(map[string]string) func(string) rt.SkyResponse]` lost the inner function and call sites panicked with `reflect.Value.Call: call of nil function`.
- **`rt.AsList` accepts typed slices** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. It used to only handle `[]any`; typed slices (`[]map[string]string` from annotated `Lib_Notes_getNotes`) went to `nil` and downstream `List.isEmpty` wrongly reported empty, rendering "No notes yet" where data existed.
- **`Html_render` with server-rendered form events** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. `renderVNode` was called with `nil` handlers; a form with `onSubmit="return confirm(...)"` panicked on `handlers[id] = msg`. Now `Html_render` always provides an empty `map[string]any{}`.
- **`Db_getField` on typed session rows** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. The runtime helper only handled `map[string]any`; annotated `authenticateUser` returned `map[string]string` and every getField silently returned `""`, so signin always said "invalid email or password". Now accepts both.
- **Literal patterns constrain scrutinee** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. `PStr`/`PInt`/`PBool`/`PChr`/`PUnit` in `instantiatePattern` emit a `CEqual` constraint on the scrutinee, so `case foo of "idle" -> _ ; "ready" -> _` now forces `foo : String` and later `foo == "other"` is type-checked. Before this, the string-literal patterns left the scrutinee polymorphic and the wrongly-typed `==` surfaced as a runtime panic once typed codegen stopped boxing everything.
- **Incremental Go dep re-seeding** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. `copyRuntime` overwrites `sky-out/go.mod` on every incremental build, wiping the project's transitive Go deps and making `go build` fail with "missing module". Fix: re-run `seedGoDependencies` after `copyRuntime` on the incremental path too.
- **Entry-module TypedDef generic instantiation** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. Entry-module `entryInferredSigs` now includes TypedDefs with their annotation type (not just the solved type), so call sites emit the right generic instantiation and `init_` / `update_` are never emitted as "cannot use generic function without instantiation".
- **Cross-module HM with polymorphic externals** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. A second dep-solve pass after external annotation resolution lets imports that depend on stdlib generics (`Result.map2`, `Dict.get`) type-check in a consistent order.
- **Redis session store actually implemented** — FIXED in v0.9-dev. `chooseStore` advertised `"redis"` in docs/CLAUDE.md/templates but `runtime-go/rt/live_store.go` only shipped memory/sqlite/postgres; `store = "redis"` silently fell back to memory. Added `redisStore` using `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`, same gob-blob wire format as sqlite/postgres, native Redis TTL (no cleanup goroutine) refreshed on every `Get`. Accepts `redis://…` URLs and bare `host:port`. Tested with miniredis in `runtime-go/rt/live_store_redis_test.go` (7 cases: round-trip, Delete, TTL refresh, natural expiry, closure rejection, URL-form dial, `chooseStore` factory).

**Coding constraints**: none active. (The "no nested case" rule is no longer required as of v0.7.21.)

### Techniques from TS Compiler (to port)

1. **Symbol-level tree-shaking** — collect wrapper refs during lowering, filter to referenced only (Stripe 40K→~50)
2. **Selective import emission** — only emit imports for referenced packages (currently emits all 18)
3. **go.mod/go.sum preservation** — only delete `.go` files, reuse Go compiled objects
4. **Single-pass emission** — track imports during lowering, no second pass

### Build Times

| Project | Modules | Cold | Warm |
|---|---|---|---|
| hello-world | 1 | <1s | <1s |
| skyvote | 32+2 FFI | 1.7s | 1.7s |
| **skyshop** | 43+14 FFI | **1:30** | **0:59** |
| compiler | 28 | 5.6s | 5.6s |

### Typed Codegen (v0.9 / `feat/typed-codegen`)

Typed Go emission is LIVE. The goal of v1.0 — "zero `any` in generated
Go signatures" — is met on the branch. Every example in
`examples/*` emits typed `func Foo(a int, b string) rt.SkyResult[Error, T]`
rather than `func f(a any) any`. Entry-level invariant: **0 real-`any`
sigs** across the 20-project sweep.

What landed to make this work — keep in mind when editing the compiler
or runtime:

1. **HM infer is authoritative.** `Sky/Type/Constrain/Expression.hs`
   resolves annotations against cross-module type aliases before
   registering the scheme, so `f : Dict String String -> Result Error T`
   in module A reaches module B's call site with the record inlined.
   Annotations survive into codegen via `typeStrWithAliasesReg` /
   `splitInferredSigWithReg` in `Sky/Build/Compile.hs`.
2. **TVar defaulting.** Unresolved type variables default by position:
   error-slot → `Sky.Core.Error.Error`; ok-slot (Result) and
   return-only → `rt.SkyValue` (a named `any` alias used to mean
   "runtime-tagged value"). Anything still polymorphic at emission
   time is monomorphised at the call site via `rt.Coerce[T]`.
3. **`lookupKernelType` feeds runtime kernel sigs.** Db.open,
   Db.query, Db.exec, Db.execRaw, Db.connect, Context.background/todo,
   Fmt.sprint*, Css.rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla/shadow are typed at the
   inference layer so callers know the real Go signature.
4. **Runtime coercion helpers** (runtime-go/rt/rt.go) bridge the
   typed surface to the (still any-heavy) runtime: `rt.Coerce[T]`,
   `rt.AsListT[T]`, `rt.AsMapT[V]`, `rt.AsDict`, plus the recursive
   trio `narrowReflectValue` / `coerceMapValue` / `coerceSliceValue`.
   They handle the chain SQL row → `map[string]any` → typed
   `map[string]string` including the list-of-maps case that 08/13
   exercise. String targets stringify heterogeneous values so mixed
   SQL columns (int `verified`, int64 `id`, []byte `hash`) collapse
   to a uniform map.
5. **Curried Sky lambdas wrap recursively.** `adaptFuncValue` in
   `runtime-go/rt/rt.go` is the MakeFunc worker behind
   `makeFuncAdapter`. It recurses: when a Sky-returned inner func
   doesn't match the target's next arrow, it wraps again. Without
   this, `Coerce[func(map[string]string) func(string) rt.SkyResponse]`
   over a Sky `func(any) any { return func(any) any {...} }` zero'd
   the inner func and every call-site like requireAuth → route
   handler blew up with `reflect.Value.Call: call of nil function`.
6. **Literal patterns constrain scrutinee.** `PStr`, `PInt`, `PBool`,
   `PChr`, `PUnit` in `instantiatePattern` now emit
   `CEqual reg CString stringType` etc. Before this, a case branch
   `case foo of "ready" -> _` left `foo` polymorphic and downstream
   `foo == "idle"` compared against `any` at runtime, surfacing as a
   panic once typed codegen stopped boxing.
7. **`Html_render` + `Unify.Server_renderResponse` never pass nil
   handlers.** VNode trees with `onSubmit` events (plain HTML forms
   on server-rendered pages) would panic with
   `assignment to entry in nil map` otherwise.

#### Things we tried that didn't work (don't re-attempt without reading
these first)

- **Narrowing `Live.app.init`'s request-record type.** Making
  `init : Dict String String -> (Model, Cmd Msg)` looks nice, but HM
  then narrows the record type to whatever the first app uses
  (Firestore nested maps in 13-skyshop), breaking every other app.
  Kept `init`'s request argument as a polymorphic TVar — callers
  plug in whatever shape their framework supplies.
- **Attempting full Go-struct records.** `{ name : String, age : Int }`
  → named Go struct (`State_R`, `Model_R`) works for annotated record
  aliases, but anonymous records in function signatures still can't
  be named because HM can't backfill a struct name. We emit the
  typed struct only when the user writes a `type alias` for the
  shape; inline records in signatures stay any-boxed.
- **Monomorphisation over Go generics.** Rolled back after Stripe's
  SDK blew the emit size up ~5× because every call site reinstantiated
  opaque wrappers. Using Go generics (e.g. `SkyResult[E, A]`) is
  cheaper and GHC-free.
- **Zero-arity env lookups at init time.** Memoised zero-arity
  declarations reading `Os.getenv` evaluate at Go `init()` — before
  `.env` is loaded. Workaround is an explicit `_` param; still the

#### Typed-codegen TODO (carry into v1.0; v0.12 review)

The v0.12 overhaul session reviewed both items below and explicitly
deferred. Foundation work has already landed (typed-generic helpers
exist in `runtime-go/rt/rt.go`: `List_mapT`, `List_filterT`,
`List_foldlT`, `List_lengthT`, `List_headT`, etc.). What's left is
per-kernel migration + codegen routing — multi-release scope, not
suitable for a single overhaul cycle.

Tracking issues to revisit each release:
- 11 reflect.MakeFunc adapters across the 19-example sweep (per the
  2026-04-27 measurement). Re-measure each release; if the count
  climbs into the hundreds, prioritise lambda-lowering work.
- Runtime-kernel `any` returns: `rt.Dict_get`, `rt.Html_render`,
  ~30+ others. Each port adds a typed `*T` variant + codegen
  routing; runtime cost ~5 % CPU on hot paths until ported.

- **Eliminate the `any` return in runtime kernels.** Helpers like
  `rt.Dict_get`, `rt.List_map`, `rt.Html_render` still return `any`
  internally; the typed surface calls `rt.Coerce[T]` on the result.
  Porting them to generics (`Dict_getT[V]`, `List_mapT[A, B]`) drops
  the reflect dance. **v0.12 status**: the typed-generic foundation
  is in place (List_mapT, List_filterT, List_foldlT, List_lengthT,
  List_headT, List_dropAnyT, etc. all exist in rt.go); per-kernel
  migration is per-helper work that can land incrementally. No
  blocking architectural decisions remain.
- **Record struct for `update` / `view` signatures.** TEA apps still
  return `(Model, Cmd Msg)` via `any` tuple; emitting a named
  `State_R` tuple shape would let Go catch Msg/Model misalignment.
- **Smarter cache invalidation.** `.skycache/lowered/` is hashed per
  module source, but the hash doesn't cover imported module
  annotations, so a downstream annotation edit doesn't always
  invalidate dependent modules.
- **Selective import emission.** Generated Go still imports all 18
  Sky runtime subpackages even when the example only uses two.
- **Sky-test harness in typed codegen.** `sky test` currently uses
  the any-heavy path; port to typed once stdlib matches.
- **Lambda lowering preserves types** (scoped 2026-04-27). Sky
  lambdas always lower to `func(any) any` regardless of their
  HM-inferred input/output types. This forces `rt.Coerce[func(X)
  Y]` adapters at every call site that passes a typed function
  (Msg constructor or sky-lambda) to a typed-callback helper
  param. Limitation #18's fix made the adapter path correct, but
  it's reflect.MakeFunc — not "fully typed" in the strict sense.
  **Current cost is small**: across the 19-example sweep there
  are only **11 such adapters** total (5 in 19-skyforum, 5 in
  08-notes-app, 1 in 10-live-component) — measured 2026-04-27.
  At that scale the runtime cost (~100 ns × 11 call sites) is
  negligible vs. the cost of the architectural rewrite. Proper
  fix needs: (1) the lowerer to thread HM-inferred types into
  lambda emission, (2) `curryLambdaPat` to optionally take a
  typed Go signature, (3) lambda body to coerce `any`-typed
  param uses to the typed shape, (4) every callback shape across
  the codebase to handle the typed/untyped split. Multi-week
  scope — deferred until either the adapter count climbs into
  the hundreds OR a dedicated session is set aside for this
  specific architectural change. Tracked separately because
  doing it half-way leaves the old behaviour intact for
  unhandled cases — which IS a workaround, against the
  no-workarounds principle.
