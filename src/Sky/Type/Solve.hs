-- | Default cap on solver steps before bailing with a defensive
-- TYPE ERROR. 5,000,000 is ~50x the largest legitimate Std.Ui-
-- heavy module measured (heap-bound-fence.sky post-fix uses well under
-- 100K steps); the broken-stdlib reproducer hit millions before
-- exhausting 4-5 GB of heap.
defaultSolverBudget :: Int

-- | Per-constraint multiplier for the structural-budget computation.
-- Effective budget = max(defaultSolverBudget, constraint_count *
-- defaultSolverBudgetFactor). The default 200 means: a 100-constraint
-- module gets the floor (5,000,000); a 1M-constraint module gets
-- 200M. This scales with input size while still catching pathological
-- expansion (where N constraints generate >> N×factor solver steps).
defaultSolverBudgetFactor :: Int
defaultSolverBudgetFactor = 200


-- | Three-mode env var resolution for the solver budget:
--
--   * SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET unset  → STRUCTURAL mode (the v0.12+ default).
--     Effective cap = max(defaultSolverBudget, constraint_count * factor).
--     Scales with input size, so legitimately-large generated
--     codebases don't trip a wall-clock-shaped constant cap, while
--     pathological constraint expansion (which generates >> N×factor
--     solver steps from N constraints) is still caught.
--
--   * SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET=0      → DISABLED (escape hatch).
--     No cap at all. Debug only — risk of unbounded heap consumption.
--
--   * SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET=N (>0) → ABSOLUTE mode (legacy behaviour).
--     Effective cap is exactly N. Backwards compatible with the
--     pre-v0.12 wall-clock-shaped budget. Useful for regression
--     tests that want to deterministically trip the bound.
--
-- SKY_SOLVER_BUDGET_FACTOR overrides the structural-mode multiplier
-- (default 200). Ignored in DISABLED / ABSOLUTE modes.

-- v0.13 LAYER 1 — Diagnostic conversion
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- | Convert a legacy String solver error to a structured Diagnostic.
--
-- The solver currently emits errors as strings with a `LINE:COL:`
-- prefix and a "Type mismatch: ..." body. This converter parses the
-- prefix to extract a Region and wraps the rest as a Diagnostic with
-- code E2001.
--
-- Future Layer 1 work moves the solver itself to produce Diagnostic
-- values directly (eliminating the parse-then-rewrap step). For now
-- this lets Compile.hs render type errors via the new Sky.Reporting
-- pipeline without changing every error-emission site at once.
